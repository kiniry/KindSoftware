<p> Joseph Kiniry started his first company while in his early
twenties and has since founded five technology firms.  In addition, he
has also has helped get another half dozen companies off the ground by
providing business, technical, and managerial advice. For the past
decade, Joe has been an independent consultant in, among other things,
formal methods, distributed systems, software engineering, Internet
security and computer graphics. </p>

<p> Joe earned a Ph.D. from the <a
href="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>
from the the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of
Technology</a> for his work in formal methods for reuse-centric
software and knowledge engineering of distributed, object-oriented,
component-based systems and languages.  He also earned a master's
degree in Computer Science from Caltech in 1998, another M.S. from the
<a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts</a> in
1994, and two B.S. degrees from <a
href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/">Florida State University</a> in 1992.
Prior to attending Caltech, Joe held positions at several companies
including Sprint, where he was co-architect of their Internet Service
product, and the OSF Research Institute where, as senior software
researcher, he was instrumental in jump-starting their efforts in
Java.  Joe also held a support position for two years at <a
href="http://www.smith.edu/">Smith College</a> in Northampton,
MA. </p>

<p> Between October 2002 and October 2004 Joe was a postdoctoral
scholar in the <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/sos/">Security of Systems
Group</a> in the <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/">Nijmegen
Institute for Computing and Information Science</a> at the <a
href="http://www.cs.ru.nl">Radboud University Nijmegen</a>.  There he
worked on smart card systems, the PVS higher-order theorem prover, the
Loop compiler, a higher-order coalgebraic semantics of Java, the KOA
Internet voting system, the Java Modeling Language (JML), and
ESC/Java2. </p>

<p> From October 2004 to December 2009 Joe was a Lecturer (an
Assistant Professor with tenure, to translate for North American
readers) in the <a href="http://www.csi.ucd.ie/">School of Computer
Science and Informatics</a> at <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/">University
College Dublin</a>. </p>

<p> From January 2010 to August 2012, Joe was an Associate Professor
at the <a href="http://www.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a>
(ITU) and is a member of the <a
href="http://www.itu.dk/research/sdg/">Software Development</a> (SDG)
and <a
href="http://www.itu.dk/research/pls/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Programming,
Logic, and Semantics</a> (PLS) groups. </p>

<p> From September 2012 to September 2013 he was the Head of <a
href="http://www.imm.dtu.dk/English/Research/Software_Engineering.aspx">Software
Engineering</a> and Full Professor MSO in the <a
href="http://www.imm.dtu.dk/English.aspx">Department of Informatics
and Mathematical Modeling</a> at the <a
href="http://www.dtu.dk/english.aspx">Technical University of
Denmark</a>.</p>

<p> During that time he was also a Guest Professor at the <a
href="http://www.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a>. </p>

<p> Over all of his years in academia he led the <a
href="http://www.kindsoftware.com/">KindSoftware: Software Engineering
with Applied Formal Methods</a> research group and was a co-founder of
the <em>Systems Research Group</em> at UCD. </p>

<p> As of January 2014 Joe is a Principal Investigator at <a
href="http://galois.com/">Galois</a> in Portland, OR. There he leads
or contributes to several program areas, including verifiable
elections, high-assurance cryptography, security and correctness
audits-for-good, and rigorous software engineering. </p>

<p> During his many years of association with the computing industry,
Joe has authored nearly fifty technical papers in over a half a dozen
fields including formal methods, distributed systems, software
engineering, security, and computer graphics.  He has written columns
and invited articles for major magazines like IEEE Internet Computing
and CORBA Developer and has edited two books and is writing one of his
own. In addition, he has run popular workshops at academic
conferences, has been on the Program Committee of around fifty major
conferences, including, e.g., <a
href="http://www.acm.org/oopsla/">OOPSLA 2001</a>, has given invited
talks at dozens of conferences, and has taught courses on a variety of
topics including distributed systems, software engineering, computer
graphics, databases, and formal methods to nearly a thousand
students. </p>

<p> Joe has also contributed to the Open Source community since the
late 1980s, contributing to dozens of popular tools and technologies,
as well as releasing a wide variety of his own packages, some of which
are available here at KindSoftware. </p>
