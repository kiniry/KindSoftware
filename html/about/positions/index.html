<h2>Several Postdoctoral Research and<br />PhD Student Positions Available<br />
Summer 2011 (start date as early as 1 June 2011)</h2>

<p> within the
  <a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/sdg/">Software Development Group</a> and the
  <a href="http://www.itu.dk/research/pls/">Programming, Logic, and Semantics Group</a>
  at the
  <a href="http://www.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a>. </p>

<p> All positions report to <a href="/about/people/jrk.html">Dr. Joe
Kiniry</a>. </p>

<p> All open positions are part of the <a
 href="http://www.demtech.dk/">DemTech</a> project and focus on the
following research question: <em>It is possible to modernize the
electoral process while balancing the trust of the people on the
trustworthiness of the deployed technology?</em> </p>

<p> Over the last two decades, information technology has begun to
transform the electoral process---perhaps the most foundational
process upon which democratic societies are built.  Computers are
gradually replacing manual parts of the democratic process by, for
example, tallying results in Excel spreadsheets or by computing seat
assignments to parties in parliament (since 1962 in Denmark).  With
every such transformation, the overall process becomes more efficient
and economical.  However, there is a risk of the process becoming less
trustworthy.  The deployed technology tends to be complex and
therefore prone to programming error and vulnerable to malicious
attacks.  These problems have an adverse effect on the very
foundations of democracy.  Voters are less likely to trust the
electoral process, which inevitably leads to lower voter participation
and cynicism. </p>

<p> The hypothesis of this research project is the following: <em>Is
it possible to modernize the electoral process while balancing the
trust of the people on the trustworthiness of the deployed
technology?</em> In order to provide evidence in support of this
hypothesis, we propose first to design a rigorous software engineering
principle, which we call <em>trust by design</em> that reproduces the
trust-instilling elements of the conventional process in an electronic
infrastructure. Second, together with our industry partners, we
develop electronic election technology based on the trust by design
principle.  Third, together with the Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, and
Aarhus Kommuner, we empirically evaluate the technology in order to
analyze the social, political and cultural implications inherent in
digitally transforming the democratic process.  The results of this
project will provide decision makers important and invaluable insights
into how to modernize the democratic process without jeopardizing the
fundamental principles upon which democracies rest. </p>
