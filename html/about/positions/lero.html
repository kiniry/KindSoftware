<h2>Research Positions Available<br />
  April 2007<br /></h2>
<h3>One PhD Positions in Applied Formal Methods</h3>

<h4><a href="http://www.lero.ie/">LERO: The Irish Software Engineering Research Centre</a></h4>

<p> <a href="http://www.csi.ucd.ie/">School of Computer Science and
    Informatics</a>, <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/">University College
    Dublin</a>,<br /> Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland. </p>

<h4>Research Summary</h4>

<h5>Model-Based Product Derivation in Software Product Lines</h5>
 
<p> The goal of this project is to enable systematic application
  artifact and product tracking, evolution and derivation within a
  product line and to improve the degree of automation within the
  product derivation process. The main objective of this project is to
  combine formal approaches to describing requirements, software
  architecture and other artifacts with model-based development
  approaches to support formal automated derivation of verifiable
  products within a product line. </p>
 
<p> The high-level objectives of the project are</p>  
<ul>
  <li> Determine a variability model that is derivable from the
    requirements model (both domain and application) by using more
    formal descriptions of the domain and application
    requirements. </li>
  <li> Investigate how the variability and requirements models (both
    domain and application) can be used to support formal generation
    of the architecture models and other artifact models. </li>
  <li> Establish a formal approach to the definition of variability
    between the variability, requirements, architecture and other
    artifact models both in the domain engineering and application
    engineering within software product lines. </li>
</ul>
 
<p> In order to enable more automated reasoning about these artifacts
  in terms of transformation, organization, search and discovery,
  etc. there must be a fundamental semantics to the software product
  line domain and the specification of artifacts is paramount. This
  project will define such a semantics by using evolutions of existing
  formal approaches to the description of these various
  artifacts. More specifically, a logic called "kind theory" will be
  used to describe artifacts and their interrelationships and this
  logic will be integrated into the Cadena integrated environment for
  defining and modelling component-based systems in model-driven
  architectures [Kiniry02, Hatcliff03, Childs 06]. </p>
 

<h4>UCD's Specific Responsibilities</h4>

<p> UCD is participating in several specific research activities in
  this project.  Our responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> identifying how formal methods are currently used in software
    product lines (SPL) for product derivation, </li>
  <li> investigation into formal specification and modeling of
    requirements with variability, </li>
  <li> investigation into the derivation of variability models from
    requirements models, </li>
  <li> development of a variability model model-based derivation
    environment, </li>
  <li> the integration of variability and architecture derivation
    environments, and </li>
  <li> the evaluation of our model-based product derivation
    framework. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Positions Available</h4>

<p> We are seeking candidates who want to be part of the formation of
  a world-class <a href="http://srg.cs.ucd.ie/">Systems Research
  Group</a>. The group is funded by a 2.5 Million Euro award
  by <a href="http://www.sfi.ie">Science Foundation Ireland</a> to
  <a href="http://www.csi.ucd.ie/Staff/AcademicStaff/pnixon/">Professor
  Paddy Nixon</a> in Secure and Predictable Pervasive Computing. </p>

<strong>Ph.D. students:</strong>

  will play a pivotal role in developing our research profile and will
  be involved in every aspect of the foundation of the research
  group. </p>

<p> Our ideal candidates will be able to demonstrate an ability to
  both undertake basic research in Computer Science and Mathematics
  and be able to build prototype systems to demonstrate their
  research. </p>

<p> Applicants for Ph.D. positions should have achieved at least a 2.1
  (or equivalent) in Computer Science and have a keen interest in
  research.  Interest or expertise in the below fields is
  desired: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Java 1.5 expertise </li>
  <li> software product line-based development </li>
  <li> component-based software engineering </li>
  <li> the Eclipse Platform and IDE </li>
  <li> system analysis and design with semantically meaningful
    specification languages (i.e., not UML) </li>
  <li> unit, integration, and system testing with automated and
    manual test frameworks </li>
  <li> design by contract </li>
  <li> the Java Modeling Language (JML) and its tool suite </li>
  <li> ESC/Java2 </li>
  <li> FLOSS licenses, development styles, and technologies </li>
  <li> quality functional languages (ML variants, Haskell, Clean,
    etc.) and object-oriented languages (Eiffel,
    Smalltalk/Squeak, Ruby, etc.) </li>
  <li> XML-based technologies </li>
</ul>

<p> Candidates will be expected to work in collaboration with a number
  of internationally known existing groups at other top institutions
  including universities in Ireland (Trinity College Dublin, the
  University of Limerick, and Dublin City University), in mainland
  Europe (INRIA, ETH Zurich, Radboud University Nijmegen,
  Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, the University of Edinburgh,
  the Chalmers University of Technology, Imperial College London,
  Warsaw University, and the Technical University of Madrid), and at
  companies like Bosch, BMW, France Telecom and SAP.  Our group also
  collaborates with a number of other top-notch universities and
  companies in the U.S.A., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
  including MIT, Caltech, the University of Iowa, Iowa State
  University, Kansas State University, Concordia University, and
