<h2>Several Research Positions Available<br />
  January 2007<br />
  All Ph.D. Positions have been filled.</h2>

<h3>Postdoc Position in Applied Formal Methods</h3>

<h4>MOBIUS: Integrated Development Environments supporting Logic-based
  Verification of Sequential and Concurrent Java programs with
  Proof-Carrying Code</h4>

<p> <a href="http://www.csi.ucd.ie/">School of Computer Science and
    Informatics</a>, <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/">University College
    Dublin</a>,<br /> Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland. </p>

<h4>Research Summary</h4>

<p> Through their global, uniform provision of services, and their
  distributed nature, global computers have the potential to
  profoundly enhance our daily life. However, they will not realize
  their full potential, unless the necessary levels of trust and
  security can be guaranteed. </p>

<p> We aim to develop the technology for establishing trust and
  security for the next generation of global computers, using the
  Proof Carrying Code (PCC) paradigm. The essential features of
  the <em>MOBIUS</em> security architecture will be:
<ul>

  <li> <em>innovative trust management</em>, dispensing with
      centralized trust entities, and allowing individual components
      to gain trust by providing verifiable certificates of their
      innocuousness; and </li>

  <li> <em>static enforcement mechanisms</em>, sufficiently
      <em>flexible</em> to cover the wide range of security concerns
      arising in global computing, and sufficiently
      <em>resource-aware</em> and <em>configurable</em> to be
      applicable to the wide range of devices in global computers; and

  <li> <em>support for system component downloading</em>, for
      compatibility with the view of a global computer as an evolving
      network of autonomous, heterogeneous and <em>extensible</em>
      devices.

</ul>

<p> The PCC paradigm is known for decentralized trust management, but
  has generally been restricted to simple safety properties, and to
  monolithic, non-distributed applications.  We shall pioneer the
  first PCC framework applicable to global computers, and the first to
  allow enforcement of functional properties as well as advanced
  security properties.  We shall extend the two technologies that
  enable PCC--- type systems and program logics---to allow enforcement
  of more advanced security properties, and combine them in hybrid
  certificates to be checked through type checking <em>together
  with</em> proof checking. </p>

<p> To maximize the impact of our work, we will focus on Java-enabled
  global computers. This will also allow us to implement our security
  architecture and evaluate it on case studies from a range of
  application domains. </p>

<h4>UCD's Specific Responsibilities</h4>

<p> UCD is participating in several specific research activities in
  this project.  Our responsibilities include:
<ul>
  <li> analysing and formalising generic framework-specific security
      properties, </li>
  <li> analysing, formalising, and verifying application-specific
      security (e.g., SSL), </li>
  <li> developing, implementing, and utilising new formal methods for
      automatically and interactively verifying concurrent Java
      systems (much of this work will focus on the new concurrency
      API in Java 1.5), </li>
  <li> co-developing a programing verification environment, </li>
  <li> managing the software engineering effort at several
      institutions, </li>
  <li> analysing, developing, and utilising scenarios for
      proof-carrying code, particularly with respect to the
      compositional proprieties of PCC-centric code development, </li>
  <li> developing a proof certificate compiler for automatically
      verified Java bytecode, </li>
  <li> developing an on-device proof checker for minimal devices
      (e.g, mobiles), </li>
  <li> and being involved in many case studies using the project
      technology. </li>
</ul>

<p> UCD leads the entire effort to develop a program verification
  environment incorporating all the theories and tools developed by
  MOBIUS partners.  This work will require significant software
  engineering effort, coordinating multiple research and development
  sites, and will utilise many cutting-edge FLOSS tools for project
  management, distributed collaboration, version control, bug
  tracking, testing, and more.  Essentially, we are responsible for
  not only building the world's greatest IDE that incorporates
  automatic and interactive verification, but also incorporating many
  best-of-breed software engineering practices into such a formal
  framework and tool.  We expect to work with several modern
  Integrated Development Environments, including Eclipse. </p>

<h4>Positions Available</h4>

<p> We are seeking candidates who want to be part of the formation of
  a world-class <a href="http://srg.cs.ucd.ie/">Systems Research
