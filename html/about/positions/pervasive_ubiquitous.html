<h2>Research Positions</h2>

<h3>Ph.D./M.Sc. Positions in Autonomic and Pervasive Computing</h3>

<p> <a href="http://www.csi.ucd.ie/">School of Computer Science and
Informatics</a>, <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/">University College
Dublin</a>, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland. </p>

<p> Autonomic and pervasive computing encompasses tools and techniques
for building highly responsive and self-adaptive systems that will be
used in areas as diverse as consumer applications, smart buildings,
gaming, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. This cutting-edge
research domain provides a unique opportunity to work with a
combination of state-of-the-art software systems, reasoning systems,
user interfaces, content management, embedded sensors and
communications systems, in close collaboration with users and
researchers in other disciplines. </p>

<p> We are seeking candidates who want to be part of the formation of
a world-class Systems Research Laboratory. The laboratory is funded by
a 2.5 Million Euro award by <a href="http://www.sfi.ie">Science
Foundation Ireland</a> to Professor Paddy Nixon in Secure and
Predictable Pervasive Computing. </p>

<strong>Ph.D. students:</strong>

<p> We are seeking well qualified graduates, or students expecting to
graduate in the near future, to undertake selected projects in the
broad area of Autonomic and Pervasive Computing. These students will
play a pivotal role in developing our research profile and will be
involved in every aspect of the foundation of the research group. </p>

<p> Our ideal candidates will be able to demonstrate an ability to both
undertake basic research and be able to build prototype systems to
demonstrate their research. </p>

<p> The candidates will be expected to work in collaboration with a
number of existing groups. In particular, a strong collaboration with
the <a href="http://www.adaptiveinformation.ie">Adaptive Information
Centre</a> is expected. </p>

<p> Applicants for PhD should have achieved at least a 2.1 (or
equivalent) in Computer Science and have a keen interest in
research. </p>

<p> Applicants should return a completed application form with referee
reports CV to Paddy Nixon at the address below. Informal inquiries
prior a full application are welcomed and should be made to either
Simon Dobson or Paddy Nixon. </p>

<p> The application form is available here:
<a href="http://www.cs.ucd.ie/forms/UCD-CS-PGrad-Application.pdf">Application Form</a> </p>

<p> The referee form is available here: <a href="http://www.cs.ucd.ie/forms/UCD-CS-PGrad-Referee.pdf">Referee Form</a> </p>

<p> About the department: The Irish Government (SFI/Forfas) Baseline
Study that ranked Irish research groups identified the School of
Computer Science and Informatics at University College Dublin as the
best Computer Science department in the country, having "a very strong
impact internationally in their research." This research excellence is
further reflected in the large number of prestigious Science
Foundation Ireland (SFI) funded projects won by members of the
School. </p>

<p> Contact Information: Please contact
<a href="/about/people/pn.html">Professor Paddy Nixon</a>,
<a href="/about/people/sd.html">Dr. Simon Dobson</a>, or
<a href="/about/people/jrk.html">Dr. Joe Kiniry</a>
