<h2>Detection, Prevention and Analysis of Bugs in OpenBSD</h2>

<p> <em><strong>Note:</strong> This project was accomplished as a
2005-2006 Final Year Project by Niall O'Higgins (<a
href="reports/OHiggins06.pdf">report</a>).</em> </p>

<h3> Summary of Niall's Work </h3>

<h4> Detection, Prevention and Analysis of Bugs in OpenBSD </h4>
<h5> Winner of IBM Open Source Software competition <br />
     Niall O'Higgins, UCD 2006 </h5>

<p> OpenBSD is widely regarded as the world's most secure operating
system.  What is it that places it so far ahead of even commercial
operating systems whose vendors invest millions in security?  The core
OpenBSD philosophy is that security holes are the result of programmer
error, that they are another class of bug.  Thus, the best way to
avoid security holes is to write correct code.  In other words,
security is a side-effect of software correctness. </p>

<p> The OpenBSD source code has been and continues to be relentlessly
trawled for bugs. The cause of a bug could be for example due to a
misunderstanding of an API, an incorrect assumption on the part of the
programmer, or a simple typo. From time to time, a bug is discovered
which really represents a whole new class of mistake. Once such a
class is discovered, the entire source tree is scoured for further
instances of this error - thus one bug fix may lead to many more,
often solving problems in other unrelated places before they are even
noticed. </p>

<p> A large number of these bugs have been located solely by human
auditing of the source code.  While remarkably successful, there must
exist automatic approaches to finding software bugs.  One method
developed by the author specifically targets UNIX command-line
applications.  Such applications can be viewed as functions which
transform some input, typically files, standard input and command-line
arguments, into some output, typically some files, exit codes and
standard output.  These inputs almost always have interesting boundary
points, for example a numeric input may be unable to handle huge
negative numbers or a string input may be unable to handle random
binary data.  It is possible to automatically extrapolate these
boundary points and generate large numbers of combinations of input
data, testing interesting runtime cases far more quickly than any
human. </p>

<p> A relatively crude proof-of-concept implementation was
successfully employed during the course of this project, revealing
many bugs in portions of the OpenBSD source tree.  The results showed
that this form of automatic application testing, while imperfect, is
nonetheless very useful in practise for examining software
correctness. </p>

</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> is widely regarded
as the world's most secure operating system.  It represents the
  combined effort of hundreds of dedicated individuals, most of whom
work in their spare time for free, over nearly a decade. </p>

<p> OpenBSD developers try very hard to write code that is correct, a
goal which has the convenient side effects of producing code which is
also well-designed, maintainable, clean and secure. </p>

<p> The OpenBSD source code has been and continues to be relentlessly
trawled for bugs. The cause of a bug could be for example due to a
misunderstanding of an API, an incorrect assumption on the part of the
programmer, or a simple typo. From time to time, a bug is discovered
which really represents a whole new class of mistake. Once such a
class is discovered, the entire source tree is scoured for further
instances of this error - thus one bug fix may lead to many more,
often solving problems in other unrelated places before they are even
noticed. </p>

<p> Finding, analysing and fixing bugs has been central to the success
of the OpenBSD project. However, no formal database is maintained of
the bugs encountered nor the tools and methodologies which help in the
process of indentfying and fixing them. </p>

<p> This project focuses on (a) identifying and fixing bugs in the
OpenBSD source code (b) analysing and classifying these bugs, with
resulting information made available in a searchable Internet database
(c) exploring the development of software engineering tools and
processes to aid in this endeavour. </p>

<h3>Mandatory</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Evolve a structured and systematic methodology to find bugs in
    the OpenBSD source tree. </li>
  <li> Design and implement a flexible Internet-accessible database
    for the storage of bug-data. </li>
  <li> Develop a concise process for analysing and categorising
    bugs. </li>
  <li> Find, fix, analyse and categorise a quantity of bugs in the
    OpenBSD source tree. </li>
  <li> Write a paper on the results of this analysis. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Discretionary</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Propose guidlines for both the API designer, API implementor
      and API user to avoid pitfalls in the future. </li>
  <li> Design software tools to aid in the discovery of bug
    instances. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Exceptional</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Implement software tools which automatically locate instances
    of a bug class in a source tree. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Sources of information and preparatory reading</h3>

<ol>
  <li> The <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD web
      site</a> </li>
</ol>
