<h2>BON Software Model Consistency Checker for Eclipse</h2>

<h3> Summary of Eva's Work </h3>

<h4> Beetlz - BON Software Model Consistency Checker for Eclipse </h4>
<h5> Winner of IBM Open Source Software competition <br />
     Eva Darulova, UCD 2009 </h5>

<p> Development of a software project usually involves, to some
extent, both modelling and specification languages. Although both are
useful in their own right, using them together in an interconnected
way brings many benefits to all stages of the development process.
Work can proceed on both the model and the implementation
concurrently. However, this approach requires tool support that keeps
the two versions consistent and updates them when necessary. This
report discusses the theoretical and practical considerations of a
such a combination between the Business Object Notation and Java,
together with the Java Modelling Language. It defines and discusses
relations between individual concepts and presents their
implementation in the automatic consistency checking Eclipse IDE
plugin and tool "Beetlz". </p>

<p> Consistency checks are commonly being performed during software
development as they help to identify potential bugs and errors. Most
common examples are compilers and typecheckers for specific languages
but work has also been done on tools that check the consistency
between different software models, different representations within
the same notation or fully integrated industrial solutions. This
report extends this work in that it presents a relation between the
model language BON and the concrete implementation language Java. The
successful partial implementation shows that an automatic consistency
checking tool is indeed feasible and meaningful even if the relation
is not always perfect. Surprisingly, mappings between BON and pure
Java constructs prove to be more complex and more involved than
relations on the assertion languages. It may also seem to the casual
reader that those relations have many deficiencies, but in fact the
details they are concerned with mostly turn out to be exotic and
rather rare special cases. The Beetlz tool has been designed to be
tolerant in those instances so that it can be readily used in software
development.  This project and the experience gained from concluding
it also show that BON and JML are straightforward enough to be quickly
learned by anyone with average knowledge of Java. It has been
suggested before to use BON for introducing more formal approaches
into software engineering and in universities especially. By providing
tool support that links BON to a very popular programming language,
Beetlz is thus also suitable for promoting formal methods. </p>

<p> The basic relations between BON and Java are implemented and ready
for use but further work remains to be done. Some concepts can only be
mapped unsatisfactorily, however these relations can be corrected by
extending BON further and thus customising it towards Java and other
similar object oriented languages. Instances for such extensions
include static access, more elaborate generics and an exact definition
of client relations. Furthermore, BON dynamic charts, another possible
description of a project, have been entirely disregarded in this
analysis, but may prove useful when specifying a program's
behaviour. Support for additional JML elements, like multiple
specification cases, heavy-weight specifications or further operators
will also become important if Beetlz is to be used in actual software
development. Another area of improvement is the generation of skeleton
code. The current functionality works fine when used by itself,
however creation of ASTs would make it possible to pass on information
to other tools and thus provide more comprehensive functionality.
(Currently this not possible due to limitations on third party
projects but is in development).  On the theoretical side, formalising
the relations between BON and Java, which at present only exist in
structured English, would make a very interesting but also quite
involved future project. </p>

<p> This project outlines how it is possible and advantageous to use a
model of the software together with its implementation in a seamless
manner. With added tool support, as the Beetlz tool demonstrates,
updating of the model and/or the implementation is taken care of
mostly automatically and thus can serve two purposes:
<ol>
<li> Encourage the use of software models in software engineering.
<li> Reduce faults and misunderstandings resulting from poor
communication with customers and/or team members.
</ol>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Business Object Notation (BON) has been developed for designing
and analysing object-oriented programs. It is designed to enable a
seamless and reversible development process as well as software
contracting. It provides a textual, graphical and an informal
representation of the system to be developed. Thus it can close the
communication gap between technical and non-technical people
(e.g. programmer and project manager) involved in the design and
implementation of software. </p>

<p> The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a formal specification
language for Java. It follows the Java syntax closely and its
annotations are inserted directly into code. By doing so, it is easy
for developers to learn and convenient to apply. It employs the design
by contract approach by specifying preconditions, postconditions and
invariants. With its extensive tool support it is greatly suitable for
development of commercial software. </p>

<p> To make the most of a software model it has to be used throughout
the development process, not just for the initial draft. For example,
it can be used to update high-level manager on possible changes in the
implementation without confusing them with technical details. This can
only be achieved when the model is always up-to-date during whole of
the development process. This project aims to provide such
synchronisation by checking the consistency between a BON model and
the corresponding Java source code with JML annotations. </p>

      be decided) and highlights differences in the corresponding
      Java/JML source code </li>
