<h2>Data Structures in OpenBSD</h2>

<p> <strong>Note: </strong> <em>This project is being pursued by MSc
student Adam Britt in 2011-2012.</em> </p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Supervisor</strong> 
    <a href="/about/people/jrk.html">Dr. Joseph Kiniry</a></li>

  <li><strong>Subject Area</strong> Software Engineering</li>

  <li><strong>Pre-requisite</strong> Good knowledge of C and operating
    systems</li>

  <li><strong>Co-requisite (things you must learn along the
    way)</strong> Basic knowledge of compilers, standardized APIs
    (e.g., POSIX APIs, the OpenBSD kernel API, the standard C library,
    etc.)</li>

  <li><strong>Subject Coverage</strong> Software Engineering, Formal
    Specifications, Documentation, Operating Systems</li>

  <li><strong>Project Type</strong> Reviewing existing documentation
    (i.e., standards documents, man pages, and code comments) and
    writing formal specification of (portions of) critical, key C
    APIs</li>

  <li> <strong>Hardware/Software:</strong> Any machine running
    OpenBSD</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> is an operating
system known for its strong security practices and uncompromising
principles. It also has a long history, being forked in 1995 from
netbsd, which itself is descended from Berkeley Software Distribution
(BSD). BSD was initially started in 1977. </p>

<p> While this software has shown that it stands the test of time,
there are many changes and improvements in the seemingly unrelated
fields of data structure design and hardware, since the original
kernel was written. While the kernel is still in active development,
the data structures used by the kernel have not been a primary point
of focus. </p>

<p> Memory was a hard constraint in the 1980's that heavily influenced
how much space a data structure could use, often trading efficiency
for space. This constraint is almost non-existent today allowing us to
consider data structures that existed 30 years ago but that used too
much memory. </p> 

<p> Furthermore, there have been many improvements or new data
structures that might make sense to use in the kernel. Most notably is
the development of pure data structures. </p>

<p> The state of data structures can be summed up by an OpenBSD committer:
<quote> "There are lots of very simple structures, like lists, still
being used.  The hash table implementation is also weak sauce."
</quote> </p>

<p> The project goal is to analyse the existing data structures used by
the kernel to see if improvements can be made either in terms of
security, efficiency, or both. This is an area where even moderate
increases in efficiency can have a large impact on overall system
performance because data structures are so fundamental to many parts
of the kernel. </p>

<h3>Mandatory</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Gain familiarity with OpenBSD. </li>
      
  <li> Gain familiarity with tools like GrammaTech's CodeSurfer. </li>

  <li> Analyze the OpenBSD kernel to find what data structures are
      being used and where. </li>

  <li> A study of the current relevant literature in both data
      structures and (OpenBSD) kernel development </li>

  <li> Evaluate the OpenBSD kernel to find where data structure
      changes could have the largest impact. </li>
      
  <li> Design and implement appropriate data structures where a change
      would have the largest impact. </li>
