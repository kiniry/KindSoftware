<h2>Project Proposals</h2>

<p> These project proposals are written by KindSoftware researchers
and may be chosen by advanced undergraduates for undergraduate theses,
M.Sc. students for theses (at DTU, ITU, and elsewhere), and visiting
undergraduate and postgraduate Summer internship students. </p>

<p> Note that all of these projects actually fall under multiple
categories but are only listed under their dominant category. </p>

<p> Projects in an <em>emphasised font</em> are no longer available as
someone is working on the problem at this time. </p>

<p> Choose the links at right for more information about past and
long-term projects. </p>

<p> <strong>(June 2012) I am no longer available to directly supervise
ITU BSc and MSc students.  If you have an interest in a
security-related thesis topic, please contact me anyway as we might be
able to work out some kind of co-supervision
    arrangement.</strong> </p>

<p> <strong>(November 2012)</strong>  I am now at DTU, so am
considering thesis students there. </p>

<p> Each project has a name, a "Hollywood" pitch, a precondition that
stipulates what you need to know to attempt the project, and a
postcondition that summarizes what you will learn if you succeed in
the goals of the project.  Also included in each description is its
"secret sauce," which is the primary ingredient that makes the project
special.  All of these projects have a proper research sub-component
and all are potential fonts for a peer-reviewed published paper.</p>
