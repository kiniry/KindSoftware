<h3>Description</h3>

<p> The Kiezen op Afstand (KOA) system is the world's first Open
Source Internet Voting System.  The KOA system was designed,
developed, tested, and deployed by LogicaCMG, a Dutch consulting firm,
under contract with the Dutch Government.  The KOA system was Open
Sourced by the Dutch Government under the GPL license in July of 2004,
partially due to the influence of my previous research group (the
Security of Systems [SoS] Group at the University of Nijmegen). </p>

<p> Early in 2004 the SoS group, under contract with the Dutch
Government, implemented a vote tally application.  This application
was used to count the votes cast by Dutch expatriates in the recent EU
elections. </p>

<p> The tally application was designed, formally specified,
implemented, and tested by three Ph.D.s in six weeks.  The core of the
system was best-effort verified with ESC/Java2, and the rest of the
system was tested using a combination of the JML runtime assertion
checker and the JML unit test generator. </p>

<p> The purpose of this project is to complete the formal
specification and verification of the KOA vote tally application. </p>

<h3>Mandatory Goals</h3>

<ol>

  <li> Gain familiarity with JML, ESC/Java2, and the KOA system. </li>

  <li> Perform a code review of the KOA vote tally application. </li>

  <li> Measure specification and unit test coverage. </li>

  <li> Determine an appropriate approach for completing extra-core
      specifications. </li>

  <li> Determine appropriate (pseudo-)verification goals.  How much of
      the architecture should have 100% ESC/Java2 coverage?  How much
      only need complete JML unit test generation and coverage? </li>

  <li> Perform verification and testing.  Correct problems with KOA
      code and specs and report bugs for problems and limitations of
      ESC/Java2 and JML tools. </li>

  <li> Post new version of KOA tally application to the world.  Fame
      and fortune follow. </li>

  <li> Write, submit, and publish a paper on the results. </li>

</ol>
  
<h3>Discretionary Goals</h3>

<ol>

  <li> Some classes on which the KOA tally application depends do not
      yet have specifications.  In particular, pieces of the
      <code>java.security</code>, <code>javax.crypto</code>,
      <code>org.w3c.dom</code>, and <code>org.xml.sax</code> packages
      need more specification.  Any specifications written for classes
      in these packages is of great benefit to the Java community and
      your name goes up in lights for all time, as specifications are
      written once and kept forever. </li>

</ol>

<h3>Exceptional Goals</h3>

<ol>

  <li> If we get 100% verification coverage of the KOA tally
    application you win an M.S. degree. :) </li>

</ol>
