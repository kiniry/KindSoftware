<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Mondex is a smart card electronic cash system (sometimes called an
  "electronic purse") that was originally developed by National
  Westminster Bank and subsequently sold to MasterCard International.
  Mondex launched in a number of markets during the 1990s, expanding
  from an original trial in Swindon, UK to Hong Kong and New York.  It
  was also used on several UK university campuses from the late 1990s,
  including the University of Exeter (between 1997 and 2001),
  University of York, University of Nottingham and Aston
  University. </p>

<p> The Mondex system is an example of a <em>critical software
    system</em> since it is responsible for (in aggregate) large
    sums of money.  Therefore, the Mondex system had to be certified
    to the highest level.  Consultants and academics from the UK
    specified and proved critical behavioral and security properties
    about the system using a formal language called "Z"
    (pronounced "zed").  This formal modeling and verification helped
    Mondex achieve an ITSEC level E6 certification. </p>

<p> The Mondex system has been used in 2006 as a case study in
  comparing modern applied formal methods.  Several groups
  around the world have reviewed, specified, and proven correct the
  Mondex system using a wide variety of different formal languages,
  theorem provers, and formal models. </p>

<p> The goal of this project is to design, specify, develop, and test
  a Java-based realization of the Mondex system.  The Extended BON
  specification language will be used for high-level analysis,
  requirements and system structure and medium-level (formal)
  architecture design, the Java Modeling Language language will be
  used for low-level behavioral specification, and the JML tool suite
  and ESC/Java2 will be used to compile, document, test, and
  statically check the implementation's functional and security
  properties. </p>

<p> The result of this project will be submitted to
  the <a href="https://www.fmnet.info/vsr-net/">Verified Software
  Repository</a> (under construction in the UK, but the QPQ site
  mentioned below is the prototype) and will thus be a key case study,
  reference, and benchmark against which future projects will be
  compared, particularly with respect to the use of these
  verification-centric tools, technologies, and process. </p>

<p> Note that, while the Z specification is quite large and looks
  intimidating (and took over a year to write and prove), modern teams
  have conducted this experiment in only a couple of man-weeks of
  work, and the Mondex architecture should only have a handful of Java
  classes with around fifteen invariants.  I.e., Mondex is actually a
  very small system, from a software engineering standpoint. </p>

<h3>Mandatory</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Learn basic Z so as to be able to read the Mondex
    specifications. </li>
  <li> Review and refine knowledge of JML already gained in
    Dr. Kiniry's Software Engineering modules. </li>
  <li> Review and refine knowledge of the Extended BON specification
    language already gained in Dr. Kiniry's Software Engineering
    modules. </li>
  <li> Learn the verification-centric software engineering process
    (the KindSoftware Process), as specified by Dr. Kiniry. </li>
  <li> Learn the basic use of the JML compiler, unit testing with
    JML-jUnit, and documentation generation with jmldoc. </li>
  <li> Specify the Mondex system in EBON </li>
  <li> Specify the Mondex system in JML </li>
  <li> Check the soundness of the JML specifications using
    ESC/Java2. </li>
  <li> Implement the Mondex system using the KindSoftware Process
    according to the EBON specifications and JML contracts (i.e., use
    Design by Contract). </li>
  <li> Submit the Mondex system to
    the <a href="https://www.fmnet.info/vsr-net/">Verified Code
      Repository</a>. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Discretionary</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Generate and execute unit tests using JML-jUnit. </li>
  <li> Write unit tests corresponding to EBON scenarios using
    jUnit. </li>
  <li> Check the Mondex system implementation rigorously with
    ESC/Java2. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Exceptional</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Co-author a paper with Dr. Kiniry on this Mondex system
    realization. </li>
</ol>
