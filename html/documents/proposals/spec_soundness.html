<h3>Description</h3>

JML is the de facto standard behavioral specification language for Java.
Many powerful research tools understand JML, including ESC/Java2.
ESC/Java2 is the world's most advanced extended static checker.  
It automatically checks that a Java program conforms to its JML formal 
specification.  This magic is accomplished with the use of a rich
object logic, a wp calculus for Java and JML, and an automated first-order
theorem prover.

Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, people are prone to writing incorrect 
programs and specifications.  One of the trickiest issues encountered by
ESC/Java2 users (of which there are hundreds around the world) is detecting
and resolving inconsistencies in their specifications.  For example, if
at one place in your program you say that a reference can be null and in
another place you indirectly mention that it cannot be null, this is an
inconsistency, and therefore your specification is not logically sound.

Over the years we have developed a process by which one can determine if an 
inconsistency exists and, if so, where it is.  Unfortunately, this is a
manual, labor-intensive process.  Happily, it is quite regular, and therefore
can be automated.  

The goal of this project is to automate and extend this process, thereby 
adding the most requested (and terrifically important) functionality to 
ESC/Java3.  The results of this work will be part of a new release of the
tool and a research publication with Dr. Kiniry.

<h3>Mandatory Goals</h3>

<ol>

  <li> Build experience with specification and verification with JML
    and ESC/Java2. </li>
  <li> Identification of key strategies for specification
    refinement. </li>
  <li> Identification of strategies for detecting soundness
    problems. </li>
  <li> Design for new ESC/Java3 functionality that automatically
    realizes the strategies practiced "by-hand" today for 2) and
    3). </li>
  <li> Implementation of design. </li>
  <li> Testing of implementation on small case studies. </li>
  <li> Release to the world with a new version of ESC/Java3! </li>
  <li> Write, submit, and publish a paper on the results. </li>

</ol>
  
<h3>Discretionary Goals</h3>

<ol>

  <li> Examining all existing specifications of core Java classes
    (much of the java.lang and java.util packages) for inconsistencies
    would be an excellent case study that would be a wonderful service
    to the community and would constitute the foundation for an
    excellent conference research paper. </li>

</ol>

<h3>Exceptional Goals</h3>

<ol>

  <li> The development of a formal model of program refinement that
    includes specification refinement and soundness would be
    outstanding. </li>

</ol>
