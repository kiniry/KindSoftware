<h2>CHARTER-Critical and High Assurance Requirements Transformed through
Engineering Rigour</h2>
         
<h3><em>Funding Agency:</em> European Union Framework 7, ARTEMIS-2008-1</h3>

<p><em>Start date:</em> 1 April 2009</p> 
<p><em>Duration:</em> 36 months</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p> Today, embedded software systems assist, accelerate, and control
various aspects of European society. They enable businesses to perform
better and make citizen's lives more convenient. Just a few,
especially such as for aircraft control and nuclear power supply, are
critical to human life. This will change drastically. </p>

<p> Future generations will experience software pervasiveness that can
hardly be imagined today. Embedded systems will literally be found
everywhere and control almost everything. Human life will depend on
software to an inconceivable extent. To protect our society from the
resulting severe risks, ever more software will be subject to
governmental regulations. Whenever software is deployed in sensitive
applications, certification processes will be needed. The costly and
time-consuming procedures employed today to verify new software, for
example in the air flight industry, will fail to meet demands of this
scale. </p>

<p> CHARTER will ease, accelerate, and cost-reduce the certification
of critical embedded systems by melding Real-time Java, Model Driven
Development, rule-based compilation, and formal verification. This
approach, Quality-Embedded Development (QED), will push software
certification to a new level and thereby significantly contribute to
the safety and security of the upcoming age of an embedded software
society. </p>

<h3>Research Focus</h3>

<p> The focus of Dr. Kiniry's work in CHARTER is <em>Model-based
Reasoning about Concurrency in RTSJ (the Real-Time Specification for
Java)</em>. </p>

<p> RTSJ's concurrency semantics are much stronger than those of
standard Java. In particular, the formal specification of threads is
now possible as priorities and scheduling are a core part of the
standard. Moreover, because of improvements made to the Java Memory
Model (JSR 133) and the availability of high-level concurrency
constructs (JSR 166), reasoning about multitasking programs at the
model level is tractable. </p>

<p> Our work focuses on developing with highest priority a small set
of native JML types focused on all of the low-level (i.e., locks,
blocks, monitors, and threads), and some of the key high-level
concurrency constructs available in Real-Time Java. These native JML
types will be mechanically formally specified in such a way that
reasoning about existing current Safety-Critical Java code can be
performed primarily, and perhaps exclusively, at the model level. </p>

<p> Moreover, leveraging existing work in UTP will then enable the
specification and verification of the concurrent facets of a system
using appropriate formalisms and tools (e.g., model checkers for
formal frameworks like CSP, UNITY, and UPPAAL) to support the
automatic generation of fully annotated, well documented, verifiable
source code. </p>

<p> The mandatory sub-tasks of this task include: (1) the high-level
specification of the core concurrency constructs of RTSJ (as mentioned
above) in both JML and in a mechanical theorem prover, (2) provide a
formal method with tool support for reasoning about these high-level
constructs based upon existing work in reasoning about concurrent Java
(as accomplished, in part, by CHARTER participants Chalmers and
Nijmegen as part of the FP6 project "<a
href="mobius.html">Mobius</a>"), and (3) specifying and verifying the
implementation and use of the most commonly used high-level
concurrency classes from JSR 166 used in RTSJ systems. </p>

<p> The secondary sub-task is (4) reusing an existing concurrency
formalization methodology and tool-set (e.g., CSP and FDR) to generate
concurrent Java code with formal annotations that is easily verified
using the results of (1)-(3). </p>

<p> <strong>Deliverables</strong>

<ul>

  <li> <a href="D6.3_JML_Model_for_Realtime_Concurrency_1.0.pdf"><em>D6.3</em>: JML Model for Real-time Concurrency (month 18)</a>
  <br />

      A set of JML models formalizing key concurrency constructs in
      Safety-Critical Java (SCJ). Formal JML model-based
      specifications will be written and checked for correctness for
      the typical set (i.e., cover the standard use cases seen in
      practice) of concurrency constructs used in SCJ. We will
      identify this typical set through the static analysis of the
      design and implementation of a large body of existing SCJ
      software. Each module specification will cover the entire public
      interface of the class or interface in question and its utility
      will be measured in terms of its verification efficiency with
      respect to the concurrency checker of D6.4. </li>

  <li> <em>D6.4</em>: A Concurrency Checker (month 24) <br />

      A prototype checker for checking safety and liveness concurrency
      properties of Real-time Java programs annotated with JML
      mode-based specifications produced by D6.3. This checker will
      have both a static/automatic and a dynamic/interactive mode of
      operation, as appropriate for the verification and resources
      on-hand. It will leverage existing tools (e.g., generic and
      concurrency theory-specific model checkers, the JML tool suite,
      Mobius tools, etc.) for reasoning about concurrent models as
      well as incorporate new, novel techniques (e.g. speculatively,
      automatic decision procedures for concurrent separation
      logic). The concurrency checkers utility will be measured in
      terms of the differential in verification code coverage obtained
      for the CHARTER case studies that involve concurrency. </li>
