<h2>Refinement-centric Reliable Software Development: <br/>
The EBON (Extended Business Object Notation) Tool Suite </h2>

<h3>Funded by the <a href="http://www.ircset.ie/">IRCSET Embark
Initiative</a></h3>

<h3>IRCSET Fellow: <a href="/about/people/fdf.html">Fintan Fairmichael</a></h3>

<p> Popular high-level "modeling" languages in current use (e.g., UML)
are not amenable to formal analysis because of a lack of semantics and
interoperable tool support.  Even so, high-level representations are
compelling and useful in modern software engineering practise and
software engineers regularly struggle with using these inadequate
languages, even for mission critical applications.</p>

<p> BON is a high-level specification language for describing
structured systems, including programs, web sites, databases,
etc. BON, unlike some of its more popular counterparts like UML, has a
semantics, is very easy to learn and write, has a graphical and
textual notation, and can be used for many different domains.</p>

<p> A BON lexer, parser, and typechecker are now available as a part
of the <a href="/products/opensource/BONc/">BONc Tool Suite</a>,
available via KindSoftware.  EBON stands for "Extended BON". It is a
richer specification language that adds a number of new constructs
called "semantic properties". </p>

<p> These properties are domain-specific and have rich but intuitive
semantics that are directly expressed in software engineering
artifacts and processes.  Examples of domains currently covered with
semantic properties include concurrency, ownership, responsibility,
bug tracking, literate programming, and version control.</p>

<p> The goal of this project is to take the next steps in the
development of EBON, namely a formal specification of its semantics
within a logical framework and the evolution of an EBON software
architecture.</p>

<p> The semantics will be written in kind theory, a higher-order logic
developed previously for reasoning about reusable assets.  A formal
bi-refinement must also be defined between EBON and JML.</p>

<p> The software architecture includes the development of EBON parser,
typechecker, visualizer, and documentation generator.  The
aforementioned refinement relation will facilitate code generation
from specifications and ensuring that high-level specifications remain
uniformly consistent with respect to a given implementation,
particularly with respect to rich semantic properties.  The target
language, as previously mentioned, is JML-annotated Java.  This
architecture will be integrated into the JML toolsuite and the MOBIUS
PVE.  </p>
