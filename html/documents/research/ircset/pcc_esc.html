<h2>Proof-Carrying Code for Extended Static Checking</h2>

<h3>Funded by the <a href="https://www.ircset.ie/">IRCSET Embark
Initiative</a></h3>

<h3>IRCSET Fellow: <a href="/about/people/aem.html">Alan Morkan</a></h3>

<p> It is widely acknowledged that there are numerous flaws in modern
software, especially in relation to security. Therefore, it is
necessary to bring about a change in the manner in which programmers
take responsibility for the quality of their code. In order to achieve
this, the main methodology proposed by computer scientists is the use
of advanced tools and techniques to create bug-free software. Among
the concepts advocated is Proof Carrying Code (PCC). </p>

<p> PCC attaches a formalised mathematical proof to program code that
guarantees certain properties about the code (such as security,
correctness, memory-usage, etc.).  A <em>certificate</em> contains
this proof and other related information. The verification of this
certificate is used to establish trust with the code consumer.  PCC
technology has the potential to revolutionise security architectures
for mobile code and global computing, and is receiving increased
attention from leading industrial stakeholders in application areas
with stringent security concerns. While PCC holds the promise of
becoming a pivotal technology in next-generation security
architectures, research has so far only considered very simple
scenarios. </p>

<p> Our proposed research involves the development of a Proof
Generating Extended Static Checker and an On-Device Proof Checker, two
core elements of the PCC infrastructure. </p>

<p> A Proof Generating Extended Static Checker emits a proof for
statically checked properties at the source code and bytecode level in
a program.  These proofs are embedded into a certificate for the
corresponding bytecode. </p>

<p> On-Device Proof Checking represents the consumer side of PCC
technology. When software is downloaded to a device, the On-Device
Proof Checker takes the attached certificate and verifies its proof
against the accompanying bytecode and specification. Any malicious
modification of the code from the moment of compilation is
automatically recognised. Viruses and other nefarious code are created
by making such changes. An important aspect of such a checker is that
it must run on all devices, even tiny devices such as smart cards or
button-sized sensors. Developing a proof checker that can operate
within the memory and CPU usage constraints of such devices is very
challenging. </p>
