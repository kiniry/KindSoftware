<h2>Model-based Product Derivation: Applied Formal Methods in the
Presence of Explicit Variability and Commonality</h2>
         
<h3>Funded by <a href="https://www.sfi.ie/">Science Foundation
Ireland</a> <a href="https://www.lero.ie/">Lero CSET</a></h3>

<p> The goal of this project is to enable systematic application
artifact and product tracking, evolution and derivation within a
product line and to improve the degree of automation within the
product derivation process. The main objective of this project is to
combine formal approaches to describing requirements, software
architecture and other artifacts with model-based development
approaches to support formal automated derivation of verifiable
products within a product line. </p>

<p> The high-level objectives of the project are:

<ul>

  <li> Determine a variability model that is derivable from the
      requirements model (both domain and application) by using more
      formal descriptions of the domain and application
      requirements. </li>
      
  <li> Investigate how the variability and requirements models (both
      domain and application) can be used to support formal generation
      of the architecture models and other artifact models. </li>
      
  <li> Establish a formal approach to the definition of variability
      between the variability, requirements, architecture and other
      artifact models both in the domain engineering and application
      engineering within software product lines. </li>
      
</ul>

<p> In order to enable more automated reasoning about these artefacts
in terms of transformation, organization, search and discovery,
etc. there must be a fundamental semantics to the software product
line domain and the specification of artefacts is paramount. This
project will define such a semantics by using evolutions of existing
formal approaches to the description of these various artifacts. More
specifically, a logic called kind theory be used to describe artefacts
and their interrelationships and this logic will be integrated into
the <a href="https://cadena.projects.cis.ksu.edu/">Cadena</a>
integrated environment for defining and modeling component-based
systems in model-driven architectures. </p>
