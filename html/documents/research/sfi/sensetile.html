<h2>The UCD CASL SenseTile System</h2>
 
<h3>Funded by <a href="http://www.sfi.ie/">Science Foundation
Ireland</a></h3>

<h3>Co-PI: <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/research/people/electricelectronmecheng/drscottthurstonrickard/">Dr. Scott Rickard</a></h3>

<p> Sensor networks are widely seen as an essential technology for
supporting next-generation scientific and engineering challenges,
including environmental monitoring, climate change, assisted living,
national security and intensive agriculture. Addressing these problems
requires two complementary strands of research: </p>

<ol>

  <li> to understand the specific physical and/or social phenomena of
 interest against which to fit data collection and analysis </li>
    
 <li> to understand the general scientific and technological
 principles governing scalable sensor networking in order to maximize
 the leverage gained from on-going developments. </li>
     
</ol>

<p> Amongst the core general challenges are the collection of large
volumes of multimedia data, its storage, cataloging, retrieval and
processing in such a way as to minimize physical and intellectual
costs of accessing the available data. This is especially important in
pursuit of cross-disciplinary projects involving different analysis
methodologies and constraints. At the same time, it is impossible to
study sensor networking completely separate from practical
applications which provide real-world validation and verification of
the techniques being developed. </p>

<p> This proposal requests funding for a facility, the SenseTile
system, to support large-scale experiments with complex multimedia
sensing and processing at terabyte scales. The proposed equipment
consists of a rich and reusable sensor platform easily deployable into
the built environment for easy experimentation and representative of
platforms suitable for wider uses, together with data storage and
processing capacity and associated high-speed interconnect. </p>

<p> The delivery of this facility will allow the research teams to
attack problems on a scale and in a manner not previously
possible. The key research challenges this facility will address
include: </p>

<ul>
 <li> dealing with uncertainty in sensor systems </li>
 <li> robust management of large (multi-terabyte) sensing data on
     heterogeneous platforms </li>
 <li> interaction and activity recognition </li>
 <li> sparse signal analysis </li>
 <li> coding and securing sensor interactions </li> 
</ul>

<p> Underpinning each of these key challenges is a fundamental need
for an integrated, multi-modal sensor test bed that has two unique
characteristics. firstly, it must be reconfigurable and be easily
targeted to collect defined data sets. Secondly, and perhaps most
importantly, it must be of sufficient size and complexity to ensure
that the challenges listed above, and the resulting theories and
techniques, can be evaluated in a scientifically rigorous manner. It
is our contention that this facility will provide a capability unique
in the world in terms of its scale and flexibility for performing
in-depth investigation of both the specific and general issues in
large-scale sensor networking. Furthermore, it will provide
synergistic benefits in supporting the development of reference data
sets and services for use by other researchers internationally. </p>
