<h2>Distributed Collaborative Verification of Concurrent Software Systems</h2>

<h3>Funded by <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/">University College
Dublin</a></h3>

<p> Applied formal methods has turned a corner over the past few
years. The semantics, specification, and verification communities now
have a sufficient level of mathematical sophistication and adequate
computational resources available such that automatic and interactive
verification of software components written in modern programming
languages like Java is possible.  Unfortunately, the computational
resources necessary to perform the verification of real world programs
(as opposed to toy examples) are extreme, particularly with regard to
the amount of memory used in the computations.  While fund-raising for
resources like personnel and travel has been moderately successful in
recent years, funding equipment purchases is spartan.  There is a dire
need for distributed, collaborative computational
resources---resources that are in a global common pool, usable by
anyone performing large-scale program verification.  The intention of
this award is to kick-start the the construction of such a
computational resource, known as the "Mobius Cluster".  These
computational resources will be made available transparently via the
<a href="/products/opensource/Mobius/">Mobius Program Verification
Environment</a> (PVE), the design and development of which UCD, led by
<a href="/about/people/jrk.html">Dr. Kiniry</a>, is responsible. </p>

<p> This proposal's focus is kick-starting the construction of a
distributed, collaborative computational cluster for Java program
verification.  The participants in this collaboration represent
several of the major players in this domain, and each of them has the
need for, and will have access to, the resources afforded by this
award. </p>

<p> The Systems Research Group at the School of Computer Science and
Informatics (CSI) at UCD, which Dr. Kiniry co-founded and co-leads, is
recognized as a world-class research group in applied formal
methods. Support of this effort will continue to raise the profile and
quality perceptions of Computer Science researchers around the world
of UCD.  As a result of this award, UCD will become known as the
"keystone" or "computation hub" of concurrent systems verification.
Our intention is to kickstart funding of complementary computational
resources at partner institutions (listed below). </p>

<h4> Partners/Collaborators </h4>

University of California, Santa Cruz     Concordia University
Kansas State University                  SRI International
Stevens Institute of Technology
</pre>

<p> One or more research groups at each of the above Universities and
companies will have need for, and access to, the resources afforded in
this small equipment award.  They will use these resources via the
Mobius IVE, interactively and automatically performing verifications
of concurrent Java components in a distributed, collaborative
fashion. </p>

<p> To guarantee high-availability and maximum utility, this project needs
two multiprocessor servers to bootstrap the "Mobius Cluster".  As we
need as much memory as possible in a commodity machine, purchasing
multiple Apple Xserve nodes is the most cost-effective choice, as
comparable machines from providers like Dell cost twice as much for a
comparable configuration.  We expect to wait for the new Intel-based
Xserve machines to be released before making the purchase, thus budget
costs above are only estimates based upon the cost of existing
G5-based machines and our knowledge of Apple pricing schemes over the
past decade. </p>

<p> The proposed system configuration is as follows:
<ul>
  <li> Xserve Node G5, 1x500GB Serial ATA, 16GB DDR400 ECC SDRAM -
      8x2GB, Dual 2.3GHz PowerPC G5 </li>
</ul>
