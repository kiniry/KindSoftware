<h3><a href="/documents/talks/Effectively_Using_JML.pdf">
Effectively Using JML</a><br />
Software Engineering Processes incorporating Formal Specification</h3>

<p> Using a formal methodology, like that embodied by JML, for
software construction is more than learning a specification language,
a set of tools, and hiring some experts---it also means successfully
applying the ideas, tools, and techniques in a coherent way to the
*process* of software construction.  Typically, this process is
realizing in one of two extremes, what I call "Contract the Design"
(annotating software you did not write) or "Design by Contract"
(annotating software you are writing).  This talk will discuss the
core facets of a successful JML-centric software process at these two
extremes.  A case study embodying these facets, an Internet voting
tally/counting application developed with JML for the Dutch
government, will also be discussed. </p>

<h3><a href="/documents/talks/Using_ESCJava2.pdf">
Using ESC/Java2 Architecture, Hints, and Tricks</a></h3>

<p> Software engineering with formal methods is difficult but can be
very rewarding.  Using the basic features of tools like ESC/Java2 is
quite easy, but as soon as moderately complex verification is
attempted, a deeper understanding of the tool and its underlying
theory and architecture is necessary.  This talk will discuss the
architecture of ESC/Java2, how to incorporate ESC/Java2 into a
verification-centric software development process, and how to manage
specification and program code complexity.  This talk also discusses
some of the standard hints and tricks used in program specification to
deal with typical verification challenges. </p>

<h3><a href="/documents/talks/Formal_Methods_for_VLSI.pdf">
Using Formal Methods for VLSI Development</a><br />
Using Java and JML in the Real World</h3>

<p> Formal methods have been successfully used in non-software
industries for many years, most notably in VLSI design firms like
Intel, Sun, Hewlett-Packard, SGI, Motorola, and IBM.  Recently, some
firms have begun to use Java for CAD tool development, primarily
because existing tools were inappropriate for new technologies like
asynchronous VLSI (AVLSI).  This talk will discussed the adoption of
Java and JML at the leading AVLSI firm Fulcrum Microsystems.  In
particular, it discusses what AVLSI is, and how and why Java and JML
were incorporated into Fulcrum's software engineering process. </p>

<h3><a href="/documents/talks/JML_Models.pdf">
Models are the `M' in JML</a><br />
Using ADT Models in Formal Specification with JML</h3>

<p> Writing complex abstract specifications in JML means writing
model-based specifications.  Models are mathematical abstractions like
sets, lists, and relations that are used to specify abstract behavior
in software systems.  JML models are realized in a suite of a few
dozen functional, ADT-based, richly specified, executable Java
classes.  This talk will discuss OO/ADT-based models, how JML realizes
those models, how models are designed and implemented, and how to use
models in specification, testing, and verification. </p>

<h3><a href="/documents/talks/ESCJava2_Object_Logic.pdf">
The ESC/Java2 Calculi and Object Logics</a>:<br />
Implications on Specification and Verification</h3>

<p> ESC/Java2 is an extended static checker for Java.  It can
automatically, modularly verify that some Java programs conform to
formal specifications written in the Java Modeling Language, a
behavioral interface specification language for Java.  This talk will
discuss JML and ESC/Java2, and pay particular attention to how
ESC/Java2's (a) program calculus for generating verification
conditions and (b) object logic for specifying Java semantics play key
roles in the specification and verification of real-world, non-trivial
Java software.  Software engineers interested in formal program
development, theorem prover users and developers, and programming
language semantics and verification researchers will find this talk
particularly illuminating. </p>
