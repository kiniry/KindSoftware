Title: Saving Democracy from Technology

Long abstract: 

For the past several decades governments around the world have been
endangering their own democracies though the reckless use of computers
in elections, or what is colloquially known as e-voting.  Politicians,
bureaucrats, and the general public have high expectations for
e-voting.  Unfortunately, voluminous evidence shows that e-voting
makes elections more expensive, does not increase voter turnout, and
removes public control from democracies.  Consequently, virtually the
entire computer science community is against the introduction of
computers in elections.  All hope is not lost though.  Computer
science does have a role in elections.  We can improve the correctness
and accuracy of electionsâ€”not by putting computers in voting booths,
but in other, more subtle and surprising, ways.

Short abstract:

Governments are endangering democracy with the reckless use of
e-voting.  The entire computer science research community is against
this agenda.  Why this is the case, and how computer science should
have a role in elections, is the focus of this talk.  Unsurprisingly,
the participation of the "technical electorate" is the key to
transparency.
