<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> This tutorial introduces the BON specification language and BONc
tool, the JML annotation language and tool suite, and ESC/Java2
via their integrated and interactive use within the Eclipse IDE. </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.bon-method.com/">BON</a> is a high-level
textual and graphical systems specification language.  BON supports
seamless, reversible system specification from concept, requirements,
and feature analysis all the way down to formal contracts of
object-oriented and structured systems.  <a
href="/products/opensource/BONc/">BONc</a> is a tool suite for using
the BON specification language. It currently supports parsing,
typechecking, and generating XHTML documentation for BON
specifications. </p>

<p> The <a href="http://www.jmlspecs.org/">Java Modeling Language</a>
(JML) is a behavioral interface specification language that can be
used to specify the behavior of Java modules. It combines the Design
by Contract approach of Eiffel and the model-based specification
approach of the Larch family of interface specification languages,
with some elements of the refinement calculus. JML has a Java-based
syntax and semantics, thus is easy to learn for Java programmers. </p>

<p> <a href="/products/opensource/ESCJava2/">ESC/Java2</a>
is a tool that checks that a program is consistent with its
annotation. It also detects, at compile time, common programming
errors that ordinarily are not detected until run time, and sometimes
not even then; for example, null dereference errors, array bounds
errors, type cast errors, and race conditions. While ESC/Java uses a
theorem prover, it feels to a programmer more like a powerful type
checker. </p>

<p> Because (1) BON is a simple language which has the look-and-feel
of English, (2) JML is familiar to Java programmers, and (3) ESC/Java2
just feels like a typechecker, we believe that they are an excellent
way to gently introduce programmers to formal methods. </p>

<p> ESC/Java2 and JML have been deeply integrated into the Eclipse
development environment, under the auspices of the European Union
Framework 6 research program "<a
href="http://mobius.inria.fr/">Mobius</a>".  Within this large
research project, many tools and technologies have been integrated to
construct the <em>Mobius Program Verification Environment</em> (PVE),
a customized version of Eclipse.  The PVE looks and feels like
Eclipse, but has numerous capabilities that helps one focus on program
analysis, design, development, testing, verification, and maintenance
using hidden, powerful static checkers, theorem provers, and more.
BONc will be integrated into a future version of the PVE. </p>

<!-- smaller version for publicity; max 120 words -->

<!-- This tutorial introduces a verification-centric style to developing -->
<!-- reliable, dependable Java software systems.  In this process, the JML -->
<!-- annotation language is used to specify the behavior of modules via a -->
<!-- model-based and DBC-centric approach.  Moreover, powerful tools are -->
<!-- available that compile and reason about JML-annotated Java for runtime -->
<!-- checking, unit testing, static analysis, specification generation, -->
<!-- etc.  This process and these tools have been deeply integrated into -->
<!-- the Eclipse platform. The resulting IDE is called the Mobius Program -->
<!-- Verification Environment (PVE). The PVE looks and feels like Eclipse, -->
<!-- but has numerous capabilities that helps one focus on program -->
<!-- analysis, design, development, testing, verification, and maintenance -->
<!-- using hidden, powerful static checkers, theorem provers, and more. -->

<h3>Attendee Background</h3>

<p> Any Java programmer who wishes to improve the quality of their
software should attend. Also, educators who want to use JML and
ESC/Java2 in teaching, as a gentle way to introduce students to
state-of-the-art specification and verification techniques and tools
supporting formal methods, should also attend this tutorial. </p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p> Attendees will come out of this tutorial with a firm understanding
of the use of specifications in software design and engineering, a
basic knowledge of the BON and JML specification languages, and will
be knowledgeable about the various tools available for the JML
language, particularly BONc, the JML tool suite, and ESC/Java2. </p>

<!-- <h3>Justification</h3> -->

<!-- <p> Applied formal methods, as exemplified by the JML and
ESC/Java2 work, are exactly within the purvey of ETAPS, thus this
tutorial is of great relevance to ETAPS attendees. </p> -->

<h3>Duration</h3>

<p> This tutorial is an all-day tutorial, as this gives the
instructors time to demonstrate the tools, interact with attendees,
show various user-interfaces and options, etc. </p>

<h3>Tutorial History</h3>

<p> This tutorial has been presented to over a hundred academics and
several hundred undergraduate and postgraduate students over the past
several years.  The first version of this tutorial was one of the most
successful tutorials
at <a href="http://www.ifi.uio.no/ecoop2004/">ECOOP 2004</a>, thus all
course material is available immediately.  In particular, extensive
slides, homework assignments, and an ongoing book on JML and ESC/Java2
are available.  Revised versions of this tutorial have also been given
at several other top academic conferences, including ECOOP, ETAPS, FM,
TOOLS, and FMCO. </p>
