<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> This tutorial introduces advanced aspects of JML annotation
language and the ESC/Java2 extended static checker. </p>

<p> The <a href="https://www.jmlspecs.org/">Java Modeling Language</a>
(JML) is a formal behavioral interface specification language that can
be used to specify the behavior of Java modules. It combines the
Design by Contract approach of Eiffel and the model-based
specification approach of the Larch family of interface specification
languages, with some elements of the refinement calculus. JML has a
Java-based syntax and semantics.  Thus, it is easy to learn for Java
programmers. </p>

<p> <a href="/products/opensource/ESCJava2/">ESC/Java2</a>
is a tool that checks that a program is consistent with its
annotation. It also detects at compile time common programming
errors that ordinarily are not detected until run time, and sometimes
not even then; for example, null dereference errors, array bounds
errors, type cast errors, and race conditions. While ESC/Java uses a
theorem prover, it feels to a programmer more like a powerful type
checker. </p>

<p> Because JML is familiar to Java programmers, and ESC/Java2 just
feels like a typechecker, we believe that they are an excellent way to
gently introduce programmers to formal methods. </p>

<p> Most specification languages, JML included, contain, at their
core, assertion specification constructs familiar to most computer
science undergraduate students: assertions, pre- and postconditions,
class and loop invariants, etc.  Unfortunately, these constructs have
insufficient expressiveness to write specifications for programs
written in languages like Java.  The essential ingredients of a
specification language for a modern object oriented language include a
number of <em>constructs</em> which are unfamiliar to most students
and practicianers, including frame axioms, ghost and model fields, and
datagroups, and a complementary set of <em>concepts</em> with which a
programmer must wrestle with, including aliasing, class invariants,
and inheritance.  This tutorial focuses on these constructs and
concepts, explaining their meaning, purpose, and use for those
familiar with the basic concepts of specification. </p>

<h3>Attendee Background</h3>

<p> Attendees are expected to be familiar with the basic constructs of
Hoare Logic (assertions, pre- and postconditions, and invariants) and
object oriented systems and their basic specification (a la Eiffel).
Any Java programmer or researcher who wishes to improve the quality of
their software, develop with or on JML or related tools, or learn
about the state-of-the-art in OO program specification and
verification should attend. Also, educators who want to use JML and
ESC/Java2 in teaching, as a gentle way to introduce students to
state-of-the-art specification and verification techniques and tools
supporting formal methods, should also attend this tutorial. </p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p> Attendees will come out of this tutorial with a firm understanding
of advanced JML specification constructs in software design and
engineering and will be knowledgeable about the various tools
available for the JML language, particularly ESC/Java2 and the two
Eclipse plug-ins available. </p>

<h3>Duration</h3>

<p> This tutorial was originally designed to be an all-day tutorial,
as this will give instructors time to demonstrate the tools, interact
with attendees, show various user-interfaces and options, etc.  If
necessary, it can be given as a half-day, or even 60-90 minute
tutorial as well, though it will have correspondingly less, but more
focused, content. </p>

<h3>Tutorial History</h3>

<p> Versions of this tutorial has been given at 
<a href="https://www.ifi.uio.no/ecoop2004/">ECOOP 2004</a>, 
<a href="https://www.etaps05.inf.ed.ac.uk/">ETAPS 2005</a>, 
<a href="https://www.csr.ncl.ac.uk/fm05/">FM 2005</a>,
and 
<a href="https://ecoop.cis.strath.ac.uk/">ECOOP 2005</a>,
thus all course material is available immediately.  In particular,
extensive slides, homework assignments, and an ongoing book on JML and
ESC/Java2 are available. Classes have also been given by two of the
presenters at
<a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/">AIST</a> and 
<a href="https://www.sos.cs.ru.nl/teaching/ooti2004/main.html">Eindhoven
University of Technology</a>. </p>

<h3>Organizer Biographies</h3>

<p> All presenters are experts on extended static checking, program
