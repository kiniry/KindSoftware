<h2>Semantic Properties</h2>

<p> <em>Semantic properties</em> (or just "properties" for short) are
our generic way of talking about special purpose documentation used to
"tag" program structures.  Examples of documentation properites
include Javadoc tags and Eiffel indexing properties.  Thus, if you are
a Java programmer, read "property" as "tag"; if you are an Eiffel
programmer read it as "index property" and "well-structured
comment". </p>

<p> <em>Semantic properties</em>, as discussed in two papers: <a
href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/cs.SE/0204035">Semantic Properties for
Lightweight Specification in Knowledgeable Development
Environments</a> and <a
href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/cs.SE/0204036">Semantic Component
Composition</a>. </p>

<p> Properties values that are strings should be enclosed in
double-quotes ('"').  Strings that are split across lines should use
the percent continuation character ('%').  See the example files and
headers for examples. </p>

<p> In all of the following properties, <code>Expression</code> means
<code>(predicate | code segment | natural language
description)</code>. A <em>predicate</em> is a boolean-valued
function.  Examples of valid predicates for detailed specification
purposes include expressions written in specification languages like
<a href="https://www.bon-method.com/">BON</a>, <a
href="https://www.jmlspecs.org/">JML</a>, and the Object Constraint
Language, or traditional predicates in any normal (predicate) calculus
or (boolean, Hoare) logic.  A <span class="italic">code segment</span>
is a legal expression from any programming language, but is most often
written in the language of the code it documenting. A <span
class="italic">natural language description</span> is a description
written in a spoken language (like English). </p>

<p> For all properties, entities enclosed in <code>()</code> or
<code>&lt;&gt;</code> must be so enclosed when using the
properties. E.g. "(Expression)" means literally "(" + the expression +
")". Entities enclosed in <code>[]</code> in the table are optional,
and should not be enclosed in literal square brackets when
present. </p>

<p> The table lists, in the "Usage" column, the programmatic
constructs to which each property is applicable. Possible values for
this column are <span class="italic">files</span>, <span
class="italic">modules</span>, <span class="italic">features</span>,
<span class="italic">variables</span>, <span
class="italic">all</span>, and <span class="italic">special</span>.
Special usages are explained in the "Purpose/Description" column.  We
provide a map of these constructs to each programming language for
which we go into greater detail later in this document. </p>

        Describes the concurrency strategy and/or approach taken by

        <ul>
          <li class="smblue">
          <code>SEQUENTIAL</code> means that callers must coordinate so

          outstanding at once. If simultaneous calls occur, the the
          semantics and integrity of the system are not guaranteed.
          </li>
          <li class="smblue">
          <code>GUARDED</code> means that multiple calls/accesses from
          concurrent threads may occur simultaneously to one object in
          question, but only one is allowed to commence; the others are
          blocked until the performance of the first operation is
          complete. This is the behavior of <code>synchronized</code>
          instance methods in Java.
          </li>
          <li class="smblue">
          <code>CONCURRENT</code> indicates that multiple calls/accesses
          from concurrent threads may occur simultaneously to the object
          in question, and that all will proceed concurrently with
          correct semantics. This is the default behavior of Java methods

          to &lt;value&gt;, the exception &lt;Exception&gt; will be
          raised.  The value is specified with units.
          </li>
          <li class="smblue">
          <code>FAILURE</code> means that if a call to the feature is
          currently underway, all additional calls with fail and the
          exception &lt;Exception&gt; will be raised.
          </li>
          <li class="smblue">
          <code>SPECIAL</code> indicates that the feature has concurrency
          semantics that are not covered by the preceding cases. Make
          sure to explain the particulars of the feature's semantics in
          sufficient detail that the reader will be quite clear on your
feature's unusual semantics.
</li>
</ul>
<br />

A feature lacking a concurrency property is considered
CONCURRENT. The semantics description is optional on features that
are labeled as SEQUENTIAL or GUARDED. In general, all features
should have concurrency properties.

      lack of sufficient range checking on passed argument values).

      Denotes the version of the construct. The text has no special internal

      software project that contains this construct, rather than the version
      of this particular construct.

      Indicates the (release) version number in which this

      number for the particular construct in which the
      documented construct appears. No <tt>since</tt>
      property is required for features that have existed
      since the first version of the project. Often the
      cvs tag for a version is used here for the
      version-tag, but this is not a requirement. Note
      that current versions of cvs do not permit tags with
      periods (e.g. "0.1.0" is illegal).

      The character `#' separates the name of a module from the
      name of one  of its features. One of several overloaded
      features may be selected by including a parenthesized
      list of argument types after the feature name. Whitespace in
      <tt>see</tt>'s modulename is significant. If there is more
      than one argument, there must be a single blank character
      between the arguments.  See the pieces of example code
      for examples of use.
