<h2>Tools</h2>
<h3>(X)Emacs</h3>

<p> The canonical summary: <em>Emacs is the extensible, customizable,
self-documenting real-time display editor.</em> </p>

<p> <em>(Rewritten from the XEmacs home page)</em> Emacs is a
powerful, extensible text editor with full GUI and terminal
support. </p>

<p> Two primary supported free implementations of Emacs exist:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> Emacs, the Free
      Software Foundation's mainline Emacs implementation, and
  </li>

  <li> <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a>, a highly
      graphical version initially based on an early version of
      GNU Emacs 19 from the Free Software Foundation and since
      kept up to date with recent versions of that
      product. XEmacs stems from a collaboration of Lucid,
      Inc. with <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems,
      Inc.</a> and the <a
      href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois</a>,
      with additional support having been provided by <a
      href="http://www.amdahl.com/">Amdahl Corporation</a> and <a
      href="http://www.altrasoft.com/">Altrasoft</a>. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> <span class="bold">Extending Emacs.</span> (X)Emacs is extended
through the use of Emacs Lisp <em>packages</em>.  The primary packages
we use for the development of Java are as follows.  This list is by no
means complete and reflects our personal biases.  Some of the
following summaries come directly from the info web pages for the
corresponding package.

<ul>
  <li> <span class="bold">Semantic/Bovine.</span>
      Semantic is a program for Emacs which includes, at its core, a
      lexer, and two compiler compilers (bovinator and wisent).
      Additional tools include, support for imenu, speedbar,
      whichfunc, eldoc, hippie-expand, and several other build in
      tools.

      <p> The core utility is the parser infrastructure which allows
      different types of parsers to be linked into the system.  Two
      build in parsers include the "bovine" parser, and the "wisent"
      parser. </p>

  <li> <span class="bold">Speedbar.</span>
      Speedbar is a program for Emacs which can be used to summarize
      information related to the current buffer.  Its original
      inspiration is the `explorer' often used in modern development
      environments, office packages, and web browsers.

  <li> <span class="bold">EIEIO.</span>
      Summary.

  <li> <span class="bold">AucTeX.</span>
      Summary.

  <li> <span class="bold">Proof General.</span>
      Summary.

  <li> <span class="bold">Emacs Library (elib).</span>
      Summary.

  <li> <span class="bold">Tramp.</span>
      Summary.

  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://repose.cx/emacs/wiki">Wiki.</a></span>
      Emacs-Wiki enables you to create and use hyperlinks and simple
      formatting in plain text files, and to optionally publish your
      pages as HTML.

  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.csd.uu.se/~andersl/emacs.shtml">Folding.</a></span>
      This package provides a minor mode, compatible with all major
      editing modes, for folding (hiding) parts of the edited text or
      program.

      <p> Folding mode handles a document as a tree, where each branch is
      bounded by special markers `{{{' and `}}}'. A branch can be placed
      inside another branch, creating a complete hierarchical
      structure. </p>

  <li> <span class="bold">Tracker.</span>
      This mode keeps a list of projects and associated billing
      entity. A single project can be selected and it will be marked
      in a file as active until a new command is made to stop it. A
      project is automatically terminated when emacs exits. If somehow
      this fails, the tracking data file is touched at regular
      intervals, so the next time the tracker is started if there is
      an open project a reasonable guess can be made as to when to
      mark it as closed. Each session can have multiple comments
      associated with it, in which you can mark acomplishments or
      whatever. It will generate informal daily summary reports and a
      report of total hours for a particular billee.

  <li> <span class="bold">Calendar and Diary.</span>
      Emacs provides the functions of a desk calendar, with a diary of
      planned or past events.  It also has facilities for managing
      your appointments, and keeping track of how much time you spend
      working on certain projects.

  <li> <span class="bold">ECB (Emacs Code Browser).</span>
      While (X)Emacs already has good <em>editing</em> support for
      many modes, its <em>browsing</em> support is somewhat lacking.
      That's where ECB comes in: it displays a number of informational
      windows that allow for easy source code navigation and overview.

  <li> <span class="bold">Timeclock.</span>
      This mode is for keeping track of time intervals.  You can use
      it for whatever purpose you like, but the typical scenario is to
      keep track of how much time you spend working on certain
      projects.

  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode.php"></a>Planner/Remember.</span>
      Planner mode is an organizer and day planner for Emacs.  It
      helps you keep track of your completed and pending tasks, daily
      schedule, and notes in plain text files.  Planner mode is based
      on the aforementioned Emacs-Wiki mode.

  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://cedet.sourceforge.net/ede.shtml">EDE (Emacs Development
      Environment).</a></span>
      EDE provides the gloss that simplifies the learning curve for
      all the very useful functionality of building and debugging
      under emacs.  In doing so it attempts to emulate a typical IDE
      (Integrated Development Environment).  What this means is that
      EDE will manage or create your makefiles and other building
      environment duties so the developer can concentrate on code, and
      not support files.  In doing so, it will be much easier for new
      programmers to learn and adopt the GNU ways of doing things.

  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME.</a></span>
      SLIME is a major mode for programming in Common Lisp.  It
      essentially replaces
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ilisp/">ILISP</a> mode
      which is no longer wholly supported.  SLIME works with all major
      variants of Common Lisp.
      
      <p> SLIME uses a socket-based communication/RPC interface between
      Emacs and Lisp.  Slime mode is a minor-mode complementing
      Lisp mode. It includes many commands for interacting with the
      Common Lisp process, including a a read-eval-print loop and a
      Common Lisp debugger written in Emacs Lisp. The debugger pops up
      an Emacs buffer similar to the Emacs/Elisp debugger. </p>

  <li> <span class="bold">CLHS/HyperSpec (Common Lisp HyperSpec).</span>
      CLHS and HyperSpec are minor modes used to look up definitions
      in the ANSI Common Lisp standard (ANSI X3.226-1994) which is <a
      href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/">available
      on the web</a>, courtesy of Kent Pitman and Xanalys.

  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.xref-tech.com">X-Refactory.</a></span>
      XRef is a cross referencing tool for C and Java.  It lets you
      lookup definitions, uses of variables and functions, and
      refactor source code in a type-safe way.

  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">Caml and Tuareg mode.</a></span>
      These are two major modes for programming in (O)Caml.  I prefer
      the former, but many people prefer the latter.  It provides a
      read-eval-print loop, built-in support for compilation,
      debugging, and more.

  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex">Preview-LaTeX.</a></span>
      This Elisp/LaTeX package will render your displayed LaTeX
      equations right into the editing window where they belong.
      The purpose of preview-latex is to embed LaTeX environments such
      as display math or figures into the source buffers.  By
      mouse-clicking, you can open the original text.  After editing,
      another click will just run the region in question through LaTeX
      and redisplay the new results.

  <li> <span class="bold">W3M.</span>
      Summary.

  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/">X-Symbol.</a></span>
      This file documents X-Symbol, a package providing
      semi-WYSIWYG for LaTeX, HTML and other ``token languages''.  It
      uses additional fonts and provide input methods to insert their
      characters into your document.

  <li> <span class="bold">CC-mode.</span> This is a GNU Emacs
      mode for editing files containing C, C++, Objective-C,
      Java, and CORBA IDL code.  CC-mode support template
      insertion, auto-indenting, key shortcuts for often used
      expressions and blocks and much, much more.  Documentation
      on cc-mode can be found in the info pages of your Emacs
      process (type control-h then 'i').</li>
      
  <li> <span class="bold">fill-paragraph.</span> The fill-*
      functions reformat sections of text, code, etc. to be more
      readable.  I.e. They can automatically reorganize and/or
      justify your code, text, HTML, etc. to fit your needs.  The
      primary use of fill-paragraph while coding in Java is
      cleaning up documentation in comments.  Most programmers do
      not like what it does to their source code by default.</li>
      
  <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oo-browser/"><span
      class="bold">The OO Browser.</span></a> OOBR, the
      object-oriented browser, used to be a free piece of
      software from Bob Weiner.  It is/was a very powerful,
      flexible, multi-language, source code browser (a la the
      Smalltalk tradition) for Emacs. </li>
      
  <li> <span class="bold"><a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/">JDEE</a>:
      The Java Development Environment for Emacs.</span>: The
      JDEE is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a highly
      configurable Emacs wrapper for command-line Java
      development tools, such as those provided in JavaSoft's
      JDK. The JDEE provides menu access to a Java compiler,
      debugger, and API documenter. The Emacs/JDEE combination
      adds features typically missing from command-line tools,
      including:
      <ul>
        <li> syntax coloring</li>
        <li> auto indentation </li>
        <li> compile error to source links </li>
        <li> source-level debugging </li>
        <li> source code browsing </li>
      </ul>
      <p> The JDEE supports both Emacs (Unix and Windows
      versions) and XEmacs. It is freely available under the
      GNU public license. </p>
      
      <p> Note that much of the functionality of JDEE is simply
      JDEE using other packages like cc-mode, font-lock-mode,
      etc.  It does pull all of these packages together very
      well. </p>
  </li>
      
  <li> <span class="bold">Tags.</span> (from XEmacs info
      documentation node (XEmacs)Tags:) A "tags table" is a
      description of how a multi-file program is broken up into
      files.  It lists the names of the component files and the
      names and positions of the functions (or other named
      sub-units) in each file.  Grouping the related files makes
      it possible to search or replace through all the files with
      one command.  Recording the function names and positions
      makes possible the `M-.'  command which finds the
      definition of a function by looking up which of the files
      it is in.
      
      <p> Briefly, using tags with Java means that your Emacs
      knows the location and completion of all interesting
      features (classes, interfaces, fields, methods, etc.) of
      your project so that you can (a) jump right to the
      feature definitions, (b) use <em>completion</em> (see the
      next bullet), (c) do regular expression searches and/or
      replaces on tags (e.g. global replace of a variable), and
      more.  See the documentation on tags in Emacs info for
      more information on the use of tags. </p>
  </li>
      
  <li> <span class="bold">Completion.</span> When using tags
      or OOBR, <em>completion</em> can be enabled.  When enabled,
      completion will let Emacs complete partially typed names of
      interesting features like classes, interfaces, methods,
      etc.  No longer do you have to type those 30 character
      interface names!  Emacs does it for you!  Do an Emacs
      apropos search on "completion" (control-h 'a') for more
      information.  Completion is normally mapped to meta-tab in
      most modes.  (Completion can work even in text mode - it
      can complete from your local dictionary!)</li>
      
  <li> <span class="bold">font-lock-mode.</span> When Font
      Lock mode is enabled, text is fontified (i.e. put into new
      fonts, colors, styles, etc. depending upon what you are
      typing to make the display of information more clear) as
      you type it.  While font locking can make for a more
      pretty/clear display, it can seriously slow down
      typing/development for large files and long-lived Emacs
      sessions.  Possible solutions include refining font locking
      (see <code>turn-on-fast-lock</code> and related functions),
      Lazy Font Locking (see <code>lazy-shot-mode</code>),
      caching font lock information (see
      <code>fast-lock-cache-directories</code>), and more.</li>
      
  <li> <span class="bold">Jacob - The Java Commando
      Base.</span> Jacob is a Java class browser and project
      manager for Emacs and includes a powerful class wizard.
      Jacob is a <em>Java program</em> and its functionality
      overlaps with that of JDEE, OOBR, and XEmacs.  We find it
      most useful to use all of these tools in tandem, adjusting
      to fit personal taste.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Our code standard is partially enforced with this <a
href="java.el">elisp code</a> that provides some customizations
to CC-mode and more. </p>

<h3><a href="http://www.jmlspecs.org/">JML</a></h3>

<p> The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a behavioral interface
specification language and complementary tool that can be used to
specify the behavior of Java modules. It combines the approaches of
Eiffel and Larch, with some elements of the refinement calculus. We
are using JML heavily in the development of all of our Java software.
In particular, we use the JML compiler, the JML runtime assertion
checker, JMLdoc (the JML version of Javadoc), JMLunit (to generate
unit tests from annotations), and more. </p>

<h3><a href="http://semantik.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/~jass/">Jass</a></h3>

<p> Jass is a pre-compiler for Java the provides support for
Eiffel-like code annotations for program specification, trace
assertions, and more.  We have used Jass heavily in our <a
href="/products/opensource/IDebug/">IDebug</a> framework, but now we
use the JML tools exclusively. </p>

<h3>ESC/Java</h3>

<p> The Compaq Extended Static Checker for Java (ESC/Java), developed
at the Compaq Systems Research Center (SRC), is a programming tool for
finding errors in Java programs.  ESC/Java detects, at compile time,
common programming errors that ordinarily are not detected until run
time, and sometimes not even then; for example, null dereference
errors, array bounds errors, type cast errors, and race
conditions. </p>

<p> We are co-developers of the new version of ESC/Java2.  See our <a
href="/products/opensource/ESCJava2/">ESC/Java2</a> web pages for more
information. </p>

<!--

<h3><a href="/products/opensource/">CommentCounter</a></h3>

<p> CommentCounter is a small component which helps you to determine
how well you are commenting your Java code. </p>

<p> CommentCounter counts the lines of code and comments in a Java
file or set of Java files.  Whitespace comments and code lines are not
counted, nor are lines of code less than 3 characters long (such as
lines with only a solitary brace).  The totals for lines of code,
lines of comments, and a ratio (comments/total) are written to
standard output. </p>

<p> Our position on code commenting is as follows: </p>

<ul>
  <li> Horribly commented code averages 0-5% comment ratio.</li>
  <li> Poorly commented code has a 5-10% comment ratio.</li>
  <li> Average code has a 10-15% comment ratio.</li>
  <li> Good code has a 15-25% comment ratio.</li>
  <li> Excellent code has a > 25% comment ratio.</li>
</ul>

<p> The code that we release averages approximately a 45% comment
ratio. </p>

<h3>JPP: The Java Pre-Processor</h3>

<p> <span class="bold">Abstract.</span></p>

<p> The KindSoftware Java Pre-Processor, or KindJPP for short, is a parsing
pre-processor for the Java programming language. Unlike its namesake (the
C/C++ Pre-Processor, cpp), KindJPP provides functionality above and beyond
simple textual substitution. KindJPP's capabilities include code
beautification, code standard conformance checking, class and interface
specification and testing, and documentation generation. </p>

<p> The following is a brief overview of KindJPP. </p>

<p> <span class="bold">Introduction.</span> </p>

<p> The KindSoftware Java Pre-Processor, referred to as KindJPP henceforth,
is a parsing pre-processor for the Java programming language. This document
will describe the design, development, and use of KindJPP. </p>

<p> KindJPP is primarily used as either a front-end for a Java compiler
like javac, jikes, espresso, or guavac, or as a verification and validation
tool as part of a configuration management system. We will describe both
possibilities here as well as provide a number of examples of innovative
alternative uses. </p>

<p> The default KindJPP configuration corresponds to the KindSoftware Java
Coding Standard (this document). Any questions as to the details of code
standards, layout, beautification, and verification are addressed in that
document. This document only focuses on the tool KindJPP. </p>

<p> All aspects of KindJPP are user configurable. Configuration is
accomplished through the use of Java properties and command-line
switches. </p>

<p> Briefly, KindJPP provides the following functionality: </p>

<ul>
  
  <li>Code Beautification. KindJPP can process any legal Java code and
      reorganize it in an ordered, aesthetic manner. The rules used in the
      reformatting of code are user configurable. KindJPP is used as a code
      beautifier to clean up downloaded or otherwise adopted code before
      performing a code review. It is also used in preparation for gaining and
      understanding of a codebase before modifying and maintaining it. Finally,
      KindJPP can be used to process code from multiple developers/teams
      regularly to enforce local coding standards.</li>
      
  <li>Code Evaluation. KindJPP can also be used to take an existing piece
      of code and ``grade'' it. Such a code evaluation comes in several forms:
      
      <ul>
        
        <li> Code Standard Conformance Checking. KindJPP is configured to a
            specific code standard. Code standards give rules on how code is
            syntactically arranged, field naming policies, feature access
            rules, etc. KindJPP can evaluate how well a piece of code conforms
            to its current code standard. Such an evaluation comes in the form
            of a short or long report which can be automatically mailed to the
            appropriate parties and/or logged for review.</li>
            
        <li> Code Complexity Analysis. KindJPP knows several standard code
            complexity algorithms. KindJPP can evaluate Java classes,
            interfaces, and even whole packages and provide complexity
            measures. These metrics can help guide a designer and developer
            toward more readable, understandable, and maintainable
            code. Metrics are also provided as short or long reports.</li>
            
        <li> Documentation Analysis. KindJPP can evaluate the thoroughness
            of code documentation. KindJPP knows what a ``real'' comment is and
            performs information theoretical complexity measures (per-feature
            and per-entity entropy) of comments to determine their completeness
            and usefulness. KindJPP will comment on your comments!</li>
            
        <li> Object-Oriented Design Principles. KindJPP understands a core
            set of object-oriented design principles: the Laws of Demeter,
            class/interface/inheritance dependency graph analysis, JavaBean
            patterns, and component specification to name a few. KindJPP can
            evaluate Java code and provide suggestions as to how to improve
            design based upon these principles.</li>
            
      </ul>
  </li>
      
  <li> Class and Interface Specification. KindJPP's specification
      constructs are inspired by Meyer's Design by Contract. The primary
      constructs used to specify a contract for a component are method
      preconditions and post-conditions, and class invariants. KindJPP can
      enforce and/or encourage the specification of contracts on the methods
      of classes and interfaces, and can test for the validity of such clauses
      in subtyping relationships.</li>
      
  <li> Class and Interface Testing. In addition to the aforementioned
      contract specifications on methods, KindJPP supports the specification
      of loop invariants and variants. All five of these constructs (the three
      specification clauses and the two loop clauses) can be transformed by
      KindJPP into actual embedded test harness code, inserted into a class's
      methods at the appropriate points. The insertion of the test code at
      compile time, and the enabling and disabling of test code at run-time,
      is completely under the control of the developer.</li>
      
  <li> Documentation Generation. KindJPP can also transform Java code into
      HTML, XML, or LaTeX for direct code documentation and reference. The
      resulting document is properly formatted for pretty-printing, has the
      appropriate embedded links for feature cross-referencing, and external
      language-specific links can be embedded in the code with special
      directives to the pre-processor.</li>
      
</ul>

Debugging Framework for Java</h3></a>

<p> IDebug, the KindSoftware debugging framework, is an advanced
debugging framework for Java. This framework provides the standard
core debugging and specification constructs such as assertions, debug
levels and categories, stack traces, and specialized
exceptions. Debugging functionality can be fine-tuned to a per-thread
and/or a per-class basis, debugging contexts can be stored to and
recovered from persistent storage, and several aspects of the
debugging run-time are configurable at the meta-level.  Additionally,
the framework is designed for extensibility. Planned improvements
include support for debugging distributed object systems via currying
call stacks across virtual machine contexts and debug information
logging with a variety of networking media including unicast,
multicast, RMI, distributed events, and JavaSpaces. Finally, we are
adding support for debugging mobile agent systems by providing mobile
debug logs. </p>
