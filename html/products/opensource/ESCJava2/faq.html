<h2>ESC/Java2 FAQ</h2>

<p> If you have any questions that you'd like added to this FAQ,
please email your suggestions to either of the mailing lists. Thanks!</p>
<ol>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="what">
      <em>What is ESC/Java2?</em></a>

      <p> The <em>Extended Static Checker for Java version 2</em>
      (ESC/Java2) is a programming tool that attempts to find common
      run-time errors in Java programs by static analysis of Java
      programs and their JML annotations.  Users can control the
      amount and kinds of checking that ESC/Java2 performs by
      annotating their program with specially formatted comments
      called <em>pragmas</em>. Pragmas are written in the
      <a href="http://www.jmlspecs.org/">Java Modeling Language</a>
      (JML), a behavioral interface specification language for
      Java. </p>
  </li>

  <li> <a  class="faq_name" name="name">
      <em>Where did the name "ESC/Java2" come from?</em></a>

      <p> The original extended static checkers were called
      <em>ESC/Modula-III</em> (the extended static checker for the
      Modula-III programming language) and <em>ESC/Java</em> (the
      extended static checker for Java).  The final version of
      ESC/Java to "ship" from Compaq SRC was version 1.2.4.  Thus,
      when we began development on a new, updated, Open Source
      version of ESC/Java with tons of new features, it seemed
      fitting to bump a major version number.  Thus, ESC/Java
      version 2, or <em>ESC/Java2</em> for short, was born. </p>
  </li>
      
  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="latest">
      <em>What is the latest release of ESC/Java2?  What is the
        development schedule for future releases?</em></a>

      <p> The latest release of ESC/Java2 is version 2.0.5. It is the
        16th release of ESC/Java2 and its 1st stable release. </p>
  </li>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="design">
      <em>I have looked at the ESC/Java2 source, and the design of the
      front-end (the lexer, parser, typechecker) confuse me because
      they do not seem to be really "object-oriented".  Why is the
      front-end designed like this?</em></a>
     
    <p> ESC/Java2's frontend is inherited from SRC ESC/Java, which was
       written by several scientists and interns at Digital's Systems
       Research Lab in the late 1990s.  While the original authors
       sometimes claim that the architecture has an "object-oriented"
       design, most would say that it is, instead, a "structured"
       design, given the heavy use of static variables to represent
       the state of the parser, for example. </p>

    <p> I (Joe K.)  believe that this is (at least partially) due to
       several factors including: (a) the small size and close
       relationship of the original team, (b) the original team was
       very experienced with writing programs in modular programming
       languages but not object-oriented programming languages, and
       (c) the desire that the front-end be highly efficient both in
       time and space.  As a result, while because of (a) and (b) the
       design is a bit difficult to initially understand and modify,
       due to (c) it is very efficient. </p>
      
    <p> We have attempted to remedy this situation in the ESC/Java2
       project in two ways.  First, we have been writing architecture
       documentation and supplimentary materials to introduce new
       developers to ESC/Java2.  See, for example, the extensive
       "ESC/Java2 Implementation Notes" and the forthcoming "Extending
       ESC/Java2" booklet. Second, we have been writing formal
       specifiations of the architecture and running the JML tool
       suite and ESC/Java2 <em>on itself</em>. </p> </li>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="java2"></a>
      <em>Can I run ESC/Java2 in a Java 1.5 VM or reason about Java
        1.5 source code?</em>

    <p> ESC/Java2 is written with Java 1.4 and <em>only</em> runs in a
      Java 1.4 or 1.5 virtual machine.  While ESC/Java2 should work in any
      Java 1.4 or 1.5 virtual machine, we strongly suggest using the latest
      stable release (1.4.2_09 at the time of this writing). </p>

    <p> ESC/Java2 does not parse Java 1.5
      code, thus cannot reason about Java 1.5 programs.  There are no
      plans at this time to support Java 1.5 source code within the
      ESC/Java2 framework.  Work is ongoing to build a new extended
      static checker based upon the Eclipse JDT.

      information about this project. </p> </li>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="license">
      <em>What is the ESC/Java2 license like?</em></a>

      <p> See the <a href="license.html">license</a> page on this site
      for more information. Essentially, we are still contrained by the
      original Compaq license, but we hope to make all of our
      changes available under a liberal Open Source BSD-like license in
      the near future.  We also hope that Compaq will someday
      release the original source under a more mainstream, liberal
      license (e.g., GPL, BSD, or MIT license). </p> </li>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="history">
      <em>What is the history of ESC/Java2?</em></a>

      <p> ESC/Java2 is the direct descendant of the
      <em>Compaq Extended Static Checker for Java</em>.
      The main group responsible for extended static checking research
      was at Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Lab
      (SRC) in the mid-to-late 1990s.

      That group consisted of many excellent researchers including
      Cormac Flanagan,
      Mark Lillibridge,
      Greg Nelson,
      Jim Saxe,
      and
      Raymie Stata.
      The project was lead by K. Rustan M. Leino.

      <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~cormac/">Cormac</a> and
      <a href="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~raymie/">Raymie</a>
      are now at UCSC.
      <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~leino/">Rustan</a>
      now leads a group at Microsoft Research working on Spec#, a kind
      of JML for C#.
      <a href="http://research.compaq.com/SRC/staff/gnelson/bio.html">Greg</a>
      is still at Hewlett-Packard (who bought Compaq in 2002) and
      works on digital printing technologies.
      <a href="http://research.compaq.com/SRC/staff/saxe/bio.html">Jim</a>
      and
      <a href="http://research.compaq.com/SRC/personal/mdl/home.html">Mark</a>
      are perhaps also still at Hewlett-Packard.

      The main authors of ESC/Java2 are David Cok and Joe Kiniry.
      David is Chief Technologist for the Photographic Center within
      Kodak's R&amp;D Laboratories in Rochester, New York.  Joe is a
      Lecturer in Computer Science at University College Dublin.</p>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="source">
      <em>How do I get the source for ESC/Java2 or pre-built
        executables?</em></a>

      <p> You can download the latest ESC/Java2 source code and
      executables via the one of the ESCJava2 release home page
      mirrors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> the JMLSpecs SourceForge projecct </li>
        <li>
            the <a
            href="/products/opensource/ESCJava2/">Software
            Engineering with Applied Formal Methods Group</a> at
            the <a href="http://www.csi.ucd.ie/">School of Computer
            Science and Informatics </a>
            at <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/">University College
            Dublin</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="/products/opensource/ESCJava2/">KindSoftware</a> </li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="versions">
      <em>Are previous versions of ESC/Java available?</em></a>

      <p> You can download H.P./Compaq SRC ESC/Java (version 1.2.4)
      directly from HP's
      <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/downloads/crl/jtk/">Java
      Programming Toolkit Source Release</a> web page.  Note that the
      SRC no longer actually exists and there is no guarantee that the
      SRC web page will remain online in the future (we have already
      chased it around a few times).  We have previous versions of
      ESC/Java2 (version 2.0a0, 2.0a1, etc.) available as well, but
      given every version of ESC/Java2 is better in every way that its
      predecessor, we see no reason to keep old versions online.  If
      you <em>really</em> need an older version, please email us and
      we'll get it to you. </p>
  </li>
      
  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="contribute">
      <em>How can I contribute?</em></a>

      <p> You can contribute in many, many ways to ESC/Java2 and
      related projects. </p>

      <p> Most importantly, user feedback is extremely valuable to
      us. What are you doing with ESC/Java2?  What problems are you
      having?  What successes have you had?  What kind of programs are
      you trying to check?  What new features would you like to see?
      You can raise a bug report or feature request via our <a
      href="/trac/mobius">Trac</a>.
      </p>

      <p> Only the very core classes of Java have JML specifications.
      So another very valuable way to contribute to not just
      ESC/Java2, but the entire JML community, is to write specs!
      Writing JML specifications for the classes you use is the best
      way to learn JML, the JML tools, and ESC/Java2.  It is also an
      excellent way to learn the intimate details of the packages you
      use.  We find that after having written the spec for a class you
      often understand it better than the original authors! </p>

      <p> There are many <a href="/documents/proposals/">proposed
      research project descriptions</a> available on the KindSoftware
      web site that involve program specification and verification in
      some fashion. Feel free to review these projects, take good
      ideas, and contact Joe with questions or comments. </p>

      <p> You can build a new tool that is based upon, or uses
      ESC/Java2 as a component. This approach has been followed by
      several contributors already.  For example, see
      <a href="http://springerlink.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0302-9743&amp;volume=2890&amp;spage=214">Engelbert Hubbers's work</a>
      on integrating several JML-based tools into a
      single framework and Christoph Csallner's work called
      <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~csallnch/cnc/">CnC</a> which takes
      ESC/Java2-generated counterexamples and compiles them into JUnit
      test cases. </p>
      
      <p> Finally, we welcome new developers to contribute to
      ESC/Java2.  For example, some independent submissions include:
      Will Sargent wrote the ESC/Java2 Ant task, Jean-Michel Douin and
      Jean-francois Dazy contributed a Windows batch file, and Aleksy
      Schubert added the <code>-L</code> switch. </p>
      
      <p> If you wish to contribute but do not quite know where to
      start or what needs doing, just
      <a href="mailto:kiniry@acm.org,cok@frontiernet.net">email us</a>
      and let us know your interests and background and we will try to
      point you in the right direction. </p></li>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="tools">
      <em>What tools are used to develop ESC/Java2?</em></a>

      <p> Each developer uses his or her own set of tools.  Since
      ESC/Java2 is written in Java and is completely
      platform independent, we do not force the use of any particular
      development environment.  Joe uses a heavily enhanced Emacs and
      all of the tools mentioned in the KindSoftware 
      <a href="/documents/whitepapers/code_standards/tools.html">code standard</a>,
      David used <tt>vim</tt> and a shell until recently moving to
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. </p>
  </li>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="documentation">
      <em>What is the primary documentation on ESC/Java2?</em></a>

      <p> We have not written an updated User's Guide for
      ESC/Java2.  The
      <a href="ESCTools/docs/ESCJAVA-UsersManual.html">User's Guide of ESC/Java</a>
      is still highly relevant.</p>

      <p> The subversion repository of ESC/Java2 contains all of the
      <a href="ESCTools/docs/design-notes/">original ESC/Java design documents</a>
      from SRC.  These documents provide background information on the
      design, purpose, and history of SRC ESC/Java. </p>

      <p> We are also writing several documents about various aspects
      of ESC/Java2.  These are not exhaustive, but contain large
      amounts of useful information.</p>

      <em>What research tools incorporate ESC/Java2 or Simplify in
      some way?</em></a>

      <p> We are aware of the following tools.  If you have developed
      a new tool, please let us know.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Engelbert Hubbers integrated several JML-based
            tools into a single framework </li>
        <li> Christoph Csallner's developed
            <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~csallnch/cnc/">CnC</a>
            which takes ESC/Java2-generated counterexamples and
            compiles them into JUnit test cases </li>
        <li> The <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/specsharp/">Spec#</a>
            system at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft 
            Research</a> </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also, comparisons of ESC/Java2 with other tools have been
      written.  For example, see this recent
      <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/papers/issre04-abstract.html">ISSRE paper</a>
      by Rutar, Almazan, and Foster which describes a "meta-tool" to
      combine many approaches, including extended static checking.

      <em>If I want to learn about extended static checking or related
      topics (source code-based verification, formal annotations,
      object logics, etc.), where should I look?</em></a>

      <p> Jonathan Bowen's <a href="http://www.afm.sbu.ac.uk/">Formal Methods</a>
      web pages are an excellent starting point for this kind of work.  The
      <a href="http://www.jmlspecs.org/">JML</a> web site is the key website
      for all things JML-related. The Spec# project at Microsoft
      Research is one of the other most active research groups in this
      domain. </p> <!-- look up Spec# URL -->
  </li>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="simplify">
      <em>What is the future of Simplify?</em></a>
    
      <p> Simplify was written by Greg Nelson and others at SRC.  It
      is implemented in Modula-III.  The only recent development on
      Simplify that has taken place is our port of it to Mac OS X.  We
      do not plan on doing any development on Simplify, as the world
      of first-order theorem provers has changed quite a bit over the
      past decade or so.  Instead, we are working on integrating
      ESC/Java2 with new-generation SMT-LIB provers. As of mid-2011
      there was a rumor that H.P. has decided to release Simplify
      under an Open Source license, but we have yet to see an official
      announcement. </p>
  </li>
      
  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="process">
      <em>How can I integrate ESC/Java2 into my development
        process?</em></a>

      <p> ESC/Java2 generates warnings and error messages in the
      standard output format of various GNU tools like gcc.  Thus, if
      your development environment understands the output of any such
      tools, it will work with ESC/Java2. </p>

      <p> For example, by using a Makefile and compile-mode in Emacs,
      one can execute the tool and directly jump to the indicated
      lines in warnings and errors with a push of a button. </p>

      <p> We are writing a booklet at the moment, entitled "The Mobius
      Software Development Process," that discusses these issues in
      detail using a series of case studies. </p>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="ides">
      <em>Does ESC/Java2 support any modern Java IDEs such as
      Eclipse?</em></a>

      <p> David Cok has implemented a minimal GUI for ESC/Java2. By
      running the ESC/Java2 jar file directly, you will see the GUI. </p>
      
      <p> David also initiated the implementation of an excellent
      Eclipse plug-in for ESC/Java2.  This work is now continued by
      various <a href="http://mobius.inria.fr/">Mobius</a> partners.
      Please see
      the <a href="http://jmleclipse.projects.cis.ksu.edu/docs/esc-java.shtml">KSU homepage</a>
      for more details. </p>

      <p> An ESC/Java plug-in for Eclipse has also been written by
      researchers at the University of Virginia.  Please see their
      <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/cs201j/plugin/">Engineering Software</a>
      webpage for more information. </p>

  <li> <a class="faq_name" name="mailing_lists">
      <em>Where do discussions about ESC/Java2 take place?</em></a>
      
      <p> There are two mailing lists that focus on ESC/Java2:</p>

          <li> The <a
          href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmlspecs-escjava">JMLSpecs-ESCJava</a>
          mailing list is the "users" mailing list where one can ask
          questions of experienced users and the developers of
          ESC/Java2.  Subscribe to this list by registering

  <p> ESC/Java2 is no longer under development.  It has been replaced
    by the ESC component
    of <a href="http://jmleclipse.projects.cis.ksu.edu/">JMLEclipse</a>
    from Patrice Chalin, Jooyong Lee, and Robby and the ESC component
    of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/jmlspecs/wiki/OpenJml">OpenJML</a>
