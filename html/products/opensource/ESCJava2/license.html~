<h2>ESC/Java2 License</h2>

<p> The <a
href="http://www.research.compaq.com/downloads.html">SRC</a> "<em>Java
Programming Toolkit Source Release</em>" was originally released under
what we call a "pseudo-open source license."  This license (from our
reading) permitted us to modify the source any way we wanted, so long
as we provided those changes back to the parent company and we did not
commercialize the technology. (Note that this original SRC license
cannot be seen at the SRC web pages unless you walk through the
download process.) </p>

<p> Additionally, we originally understood that the license prohibited
us from redistributing the original source of the toolkit, which meant
we could only provide pre-built binary releases and patch-based
releases.  The latter would force interested parties to download the
original toolkit from SRC, agreeing to the license in the process,
then download and apply our patch release to have the full source code
for ESC/Java2. </p>

<p> We also only permitted access to our CVS repository to parties who
had accepted the original license and downloaded the toolkit
source. </p>

<p> We and our users found this inconvenient, to say the least.  After
some discussions with knowledgeable parties at Hewlett-Packard, we
came to realize that this inconvenience was not what was originally
intended. Thus, a new "looser" version of the license was drafted and
given to the H.P. lawyers sometime in Spring of 2004. </p>

<p> We have been given assurances from prior SRC ESC/Java
team members that if we release a full source version of ESC/Java2 we
will not be attacked by Hewlett-Packard's legal team. Thus, starting
with version 2.0a9, we have done just this for the convenience of our
users. </p>

<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/downloads/crl/jtk/agreement.html">
SRC ESC/Java license</a>

<!--
<p> As the license state of the original source is unclear, our
<em>modifications</em> are also in an unclear license state.  We would
prefer to make our source GPL, but this is not possible given the
original SRC license.  Instead, it might be possible for us to release
our source under a BSD or MIT X11-like license.  But until the final
SRC license becomes available, we cannot make this determination. </p>
-->

<p> Nearly all development over the past year has been decoupled from
the original SRC sources thus we own the sources and we will be
releasing it separately under the GPL.  This new work is being
incorporated into the the <a href="http://mobius.inria.fr/">MOBIUS</a>
tool, the development of which has started in September 2005.  Part of
the MOBIUS tool is a new ESC/Java3 tool which will be completely GPL.
More information about this tool will be made available soon. </p>

<p> All source for all versions of ESC/Java2 to date remain under the
original SRC license, though we retain Copyright. </p>

<p> We do not expect any resolution on the original source license.
If you are concerned about the ambiguous state of
ESC/Java2, <em>please</em>
email <a href="http://www.research.compaq.com/">SRC</a> and
CC <a href="mailto:kiniry@acm.org,cok@frontiernet.net">us</a>. </p>
