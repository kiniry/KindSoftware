	* Makefile: 
	Expanded JDK library directory coverage for my JDK-independent
	/libs directory.  Added jassworkarounds target for those .jass
	files that trigger currently unresolved bugs in Jass.  Switched
	from using jtags to etags.  Added devfiles target (for things like
	TAGS), clean_devfiles target (for cleaning up such),
	s/source/$(srcreldir) for completeness, made clean_docs use
	clean_html and clean_javadoc and removed old redundancy in such.

	* build.xml: 
	Copy of KindFTP build.xml to use as a template for possible use in
	IDebug. It has not yet been updated for IDebug, so it is useless
	right now.

	* docs/BON/monitoring.bon: 
	Textual version of current BON specification of Monitoring
	system.

	* source/idebughc/DebugOutputBase.jass: 
	Removed bogus postcondition from print() method.

	* source/idebughc/ServletLogOutput.jass: 
	Added several new no-implementation methods to the enclosed
	DummyServletContext so as to conform to the latest (2.2) servlet
	API.

	* source/idebughc/WindowOutput.jass: 
	Added support for scrolling textarea as output arrives via calls
	to the attached scrollbar.  Disabled line wrap on output as well,
	as I found it confusing after a lot of use.

	* source/idebughc/testsuite/TestSuiteThread.jass: 
	Shortened up some of the test code for readability.  Added a
	looping filler output for WindowOutput scrolling testing.
	Shortened sleep time for window testing to 10 seconds.

	* Makefile: Corrected reference to test suite package so that
	javadoc documentation documents idebughc.testsuite.

2001-06-09  Joseph R. Kiniry  <kiniry@acm.org>

	* Makefile: Added documentation on what to tweak for new builds
	and a bit on the existence of environmental variables to run-time
	configure the build.
	(%.pdf): Added creation of temporary softlink to bibliography to
	avoid adding bib to archives.
	(version): Added version number for new release.

	* source/idebughc/Collect.jass:
	* source/idebughc/Debug.jass:
	* source/idebughc/DebugConstants.jass: Fixed package on @see tag.

	* source/idebughc/ServletLogContext.jass: Added package-scoped
	constructor to private inner-class DummyServletContext to work
	around Jass 2.0.3 bug.

	* WindowOutput - Changed FileDialog into a FileChooser.  Added a
	JOptionPane for every error/confirm message.  WindowOutput seems
	to be done.

2001-06-01  Joseph R. Kiniry  <kiniry@acm.org>

	* Makefile - Added onetest rule for easy single-blackbox testing.

	* TestSuite - Added 20 second pause post-successful WindowOutput
	test so that the user can interactively test the buttons.

	* WindowOutput - Added support for "save" behavior.  Added close
	button which currently does nothing.

2001-05-28  Joseph R. Kiniry  <kiniry@acm.org>

	* Documentation - BON design is now included.

	* Source - Major changes include: base package is now idebughc,
	idebug is generated; use of Jass tool for assertion generation
	from specification; unified Makefile support for Jass;
	SimpleCollect is now in the examples subpackage; WindowOutput is
	partially implemented (save button doesn't yet work); Statistics
	subsystem is fully in-place but not yet documented at the
	top-level; all source specification and documentation is now
	complete and correct.

	* Release - Preparing for new release.

2001-01-12  Todd Papaioannou  <toddp@acm.org>

	* Visibility - Opened up from protected to public all methods in
	abstract class DebugOutput. This now allows you to use this class
	as an attribute in a class, and it instantiate as a subclass,
	e.g. ConsoleOutput or WriterOutput, at runtime, dependant on your
	needs.

	* WriterOutput - Fixed a bug in WriterOutput where the
	PrinterWriter was never used, but System.err was used instead. All
	methods in WriterOutput now use PrinterWriter for their output.

2000-10-06  Joseph R. Kiniry  <kiniry@kindsoftware.com>
	
	* Collect - Changed visibility of constructor from package to
	public.  I'm using the new statistics framework for the Dali 3D
	system and thus it is getting its first real "external" workout,
	so some visibility changes are bound to occur.

2000-07-23  Joseph R. Kiniry  <kiniry@kindsoftware.com>

	* Refactoring - Refactored DebugOutput class hierarchy to improve
	decoupling.  DebugOutput has become an abstract class in the
	process.

	* Statistics - Integrated new functionality to help log
	information about your running system in the form of statistics.
	See the Statistic, Collect, and SimpleCollect classes.

2000-06-25  Joseph R. Kiniry  <kiniry@kindsoftware.com>

	* Release - Removed all UML documentation from release because of
	TogetherJ problems.

2000-06-14  Joseph R. Kiniry  <kiniry@kindsoftware.com>

	* Design - Finished first pass of UML documentation for 0.95 release.

1999-06-27  Joseph R. Kiniry  <kiniry@kindsoftware.com>

	* ClassRename - Updated documentation to reflect new class naming.

	* ClassRename - Renamed nearly all classes based upon input from
	testers and reviewers.  Package name "IDebug" becomes "idebug" and 
	the following classes are renamed: DebugOutputConsole,
	DebugContext, DebugConstantsInterface, DebugOutputInterface,
	DebugConstantsImpl, DebugOuputServletLog, DebugUtilities,
	DebugOutputWriter, DebugTests, DebugFrenchConstants.  Their new
	names are (respectively) ConsoleOutput, Context, DebugConstants,
	DebugOutput, DefaultDebugConstants, ServletLogOutput, Utilites,
	WriterOutput, TestSuite, and FrenchConstants.  This renaming was
	primarily motivated by the irritation at the redundant use of the
	"Debug" string and the thought that draconian adherence to our
	code standard isn't always the Right Thing.
