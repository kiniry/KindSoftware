<h2>KOA: A Platform for e-Voting Experimentation</h2>

<p> <em>Kiezen op Afstand</em> (KOA) is a Free Software
Electronic/Remote/Internet Voting System developed for the Dutch
government in 2003.  "Kiezen op Afstand" is literally translated from
Dutch as "Remote Voting."  A version of this system was used in the
European Parliamentary election of June 2004 and was subsequently
released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
General Public License</a>. </p>

<p> As part of this work,
the <a href="http://www.sos.cs.ru.nl/">Security of Systems (SoS)
Group</a> at <a href="http://www.ru.nl/">Radboud University
Nijmegen</a> wrote an independent tally application that was formally
specified and (partially) verified using the
<a href="http://www.jmlspecs.org/">Java Modeling Language (JML)</a>
and the Extended Static Checker for Java,
<a href="http://www.kindsoftware.com/products/opensource/ESCJava2/">ESC/Java2</a>. 
</p>

<p> The version of KOA released by the Dutch government under the GPL
was not complete.  A number of pieces of functionality, constituting
roughly 10% of the deployed KOA system, were proprietary and owned by
the authors, <a href="http://www.logicacmg.com/">LogicaCMG</a>.
Moreover, certain other changes were made for publication purposes
(e.g., the length of public/private Key pairs was elided).  This 10%
has been reverse engineered and the entire system has been ported to
an entirely Open Source foundation. </p>

<p> KOA is also being extended to support the Irish electoral system.
This work is being carried out through the development of a plugin called
<em>Vot&aacute;il</em>.  A Vot&aacute;il's core is a full JML
specification of the Irish vote counting system.  This formal
specification is derived from the complete functional specification
for the election count algorithm as set out in Irish law. An
implementation of this specification is being written at the moment
using our verification-centric design by contract methodology. </p>

<p> Other work on KOA, as an experimental platform for electronic and
remote voting, is continuing.  First, we are identifying the core
security properties of electronic and remote voting that must be
formally specified at a high-level in a domain specific language, and
verified by providing a methodology, both theoretical and practical,
for translating such high-level specifications into concrete,
low-level specifications and type-annotations with the intention of
formally verifying these properties in KOA.  Additionally, a
MIDP-based remote voting applet has been developed at UCD.  This
application is being reviewed for possible incorporation into KOA,
using the same verification-centric approach used in the rest of the
KOA work. </p>
