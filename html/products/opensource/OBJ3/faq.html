<h2>OBJ3 FAQ</h2>

<p> If you have any questions that you'd like added to this
FAQ, please email your suggestions to 
<a href="mailto:kiniry@acm.org">kiniry@acm.org</a>.
Thanks! </p>

<ol>

  <li> <em>What is OBJ3?</em>

      <p>From the <strong>OBJ3 release</strong>: </p>

      <p>"<a href=
      "http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/sys/obj.html">OBJ</a>" refers to
      the language family, while "OBJ2", "<a href=
      www.kindsoftware.com.ie/products/opensource/OBJ3/">OBJ3</a>", "<a
      href= "http://cat.ucsd.edu:8008/cafeobj/">CafeOBJ</a>", "<a href=
      "http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/groups/tatami/bobj/">BOBJ</a>" etc. refer to
      particular members. The OBJ languages are broad spectrum algebraic
      programming and specification languages, based on order sorted
      equational logic, generally enriched with some other logic, such as
      rewriting logic or hidden equational logic.  </p>

      <p> All the OBJ languages are rigorously based upon a logical system;
      more precisely, they are <em>logical languages</em>, in the sense that
      their programs are sets of sentences in some logical system, and their
      operational semantics is given by deduction in that logical system.
      All recent OBJ languages use order sorted algebra, which also provides
      a rigorous basis for user definable sub-types, exception handling,
      multiple inheritance, overloading, multiple representations, coercions,
      and more.  All recent OBJ languages provide parameterized programming,
      with parameterized modules, module instantiation, views, module
      expressions, etc., to support very flexible program structuring and
      reuse.  In general, they also support user definable mixfix syntax,
      user definable execution strategies, rewriting modulo standard
      equational theories (associative, commutative, etc.), and selective
      memoization. </p>
      
      <p> OBJ3 is based on order sorted equational logic, and has been
      successfully used for research and teaching in software design and
      specification, rapid prototyping, theorem proving, user interface
      design, and hardware verification, among other things. It was the
      first language to implement parameterized programming and its
      module system influenced the designs of the Ada, C++ and ML module
      systems. </p>
</li>

<li> <em>Where did the name "OBJ3" come from?</em> 

    <p> OBJ3 is the third of a series of implementations of the same basic
    ideas; "OBJ" is not an acronym, but rather is a contraction from
    "object," since the intent from the beginning was to capture the ideas
    that later turned out, by some strange coincidence, to be called "object
    oriented."  </p>
</li>
    
<li> <em>What is the OBJ3 license like?</em>

    <p> OBJ3 was originally distributed from SRI International, and later
    from Oxford, and then UCSD.  Originally a license from SRI was required
    to obtain the OBJ3 source code, but this is no longer the case.  This
    new version of OBJ3 (2.06 onward) is released under a BSD-like
    license.  </p>
</li>

<li> <em>What is the history of OBJ3?</em>

    <p>The first implementation of initial algebra semantics via term
    rewriting appeared in the earliest versions of OBJ, from the mid 1970s.
    The characteristic OBJ syntax first appeared in the paper <em>Abstract
    Errors for Abstract Data Type</em>, by Joseph Goguen in 1977.  The idea
    of using term rewriting to implement initial algebra semantics evolved
    out of work done in the ADJ group in the early 1970s.  The OBJ module
    system ideas are a further development of ideas pioneered in the Clear
    language, in joint work of Joseph Goguen and Rod Burstall in the 1970s.
    Most of the programming for OBJ3 was done by Timothy Winkler, first at
    SRI International, and then later at Oxford; several small enhancements
    and some bug fixes were later done by students at Oxford and UCSD, the
    last of which appear in version 2.04.  Then, Joe Kiniry stepped
    in and created a modern open source release, which began with version
    2.05.  Lutz Hamel graciously integrated his TRIM system, resulting in
    version 2.08.
    </p>
</li>
    
<li> <em>How do I get the source for OBJ3 or pre-built executables?</em>

    <p> You can download the latest OBJ3 source code and via
    the <a href="/products/opensource/OBJ3/">OBJ3
    release home page</a>, or one of its mirrors.  We do not currently
    provide pre-built executables for OBJ3. Development of OBJ3 is
    hosted at <a href="https://github.com/kiniry/OBJ3">GitHub</a>. </p>
</li>

<li> <em>Are previous versions of OBJ3 available?</em>

    <p> A snapshot of OBJ3 version 2.04 is available via our <a
    href="archives/">archives</a>.  It includes a SPARC SunOS 4.x
    executable, but does not contain much coherent documentation.
    </p>
</li>
    
<li> <em>How can I contribute?</em>
    <ul>

      <li> OBJ3 is not under active development at this time. </li>

      <li> A branch of OBJ3, called OBJ4, might become available from
          <a href="mailto:sm@comlab.ox.ac.uk">Sula Ma</a> at
          Oxford.  Please do <em>not</em> email Sula about OBJ3.
      </li>

      <li><a href=
          "http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/groups/tatami/bobj/">BOBJ</a> is
          now available from the <a href =
          "http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/macl.html">Meaning
          and Computation Lab</a> in the UCSD Dept. of Computer
          Science and Engineering.  BOBJ is written in Java, thus
          runs on numerous platforms.  Once a stable release has
          been achieved, additional developers and maintainers would
          be welcome.  This system should eventually be fully upward
          compatible with OBJ3, with considerable additional support
          for behavioral specification, computation, and
          verification. </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li> <em>What tools are used to develop OBJ3?</em>

    <p> This release of OBJ3 was built using GNU Common Lisp 2.6.3
    (ANSI), CMU Common Lisp 19a+, Steel Bank Common Lisp 0.8.16, CLISP
    2.33.2, GCC 3.3, and FSF Emacs versions 21.2.1 and 21.3.50 using
    SLIME version 1.0.  We have built this release on a Linux Fedora
    Core 3 (kernel version 2.6.10, glibc version X) system on the x86
    architecture and on a Mac OS X 10.3 system. </p>
</li>

<li> <em>If I want to learn about (OBJ3 | rewriting systems | (Many) Order
    Sorted Algebra | Hidden Algebra), where should I look?</em>

    <p> The first place to look is Joseph Goguen's <a href=
    "http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/sys/obj.html">OBJ home page</a>,
    from which many other references can be found.  In particular,
    see [<a href= "docs/obj_bib.html#Goguen78">Goguen78</a>, <a href=

    "docs/obj_bib.html#GoguenMeseguer89">GoguenMeseguer89</a>] , and any of
    the GoguenMalcolm papers on Hidden Algebra (particularly [<a href=
    "docs/obj_bib.html#GoguenMalcolm97">GoguenMalcolm97</a>] for an
    excellent though outdated review); the latest paper is <a href=
    "http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/ps/ccrw.ps.gz"><em>Circular
    Coinductive Rewriting</em></a>, by Joseph Goguen, Kai Lin and Grigore
    Rosu.  </p>
</li>

<li> <em>Which Lisp interpreters can I use to build/use OBJ3?</em>

    <p> Currently, GCL and CMU Common Lisp are supported.  OBJ3 has
    been built successfully in the past with AKCL and Lucid CL as
    well.  We are currently working on building OBJ3 on CLISP and
    SBCL.  We would like to try building on Allegro CL as well, but
    Allegro's policies and licensing prohibit such.  We suggest you
    email Allegro and express your discontent with the current state
    of affairs. </p>

</li>

<li> <em>What systems/models/theories have been influenced by
    OBJ?</em>
    
    <p>A partial list includes the following:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href= "http://cat.ucsd.edu:8008/cafeobj/">CafeOBJ</a> -
          CafeOBJ is a new generation algebraic specification language being
          developed in Japan with support from MITI through <a href=
          "http://www.ipa.go.jp/">IPA</a> (Japan).  The CafeOBJ team is lead by
          Prof <a href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~kokichi/">Prof. Kokichi
          Futatsugi</a>, at <a href= "http://www.jaist.ac.jp/">JAIST</a>
          (Japan), who is one of the original developers of OBJ2.  CafeOBJ
          preserves the distinctive useful features of OBJ3, including mix-fix
          syntax, subtyping by ordered sorts, modules with parameterized
          programming, and it adds new logics and features to handle the object
          paradigm, including <a href=
          "http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/projs/halg.html">hidden
          algebra</a> and <a href= "http://www.csl.sri.com/rewriting">rewriting
          logic</a>, and their combinations with order sorted algebra.  This
          multi-paradigm approach has an elegant mathematical semantics based on
          multiple institutions, due to <a href=
          "http://www.imar.ro/~diacon">Razvan Diaconescu</a>.  Some theorem
          proving capabilities are also supported.
      </li>

      <li> OBJ is used in the <a href=
          "http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/groups/tatami/">Tatami</a> project, which is
          developing the Kumo proof assistant and proof website generator.  The
          project is now preparing Kumo to use the BOBJ system.  </li>

      <li> <a href= "http://maude.csl.sri.com/">Maude</a> - Maude
          incorporates most features of OBJ3, sometimes with small syntactic
          changes, and adds an implementation of <a href=
          "http://www.csl.sri.com/rewriting">rewriting logic</a>, using a new
          and more powerful rewriting engine, and using the membership
          equational logic generalization of order sorted equational logic. The
          Computer Science Lab at SRI International has a <a href=
          "http://maude.csl.sri.com">Maude homepage</a>; see also the SRI CSL <a
          href= "http://www.csl.sri.com/rewriting/">rewriting logic
          homepage</a>.  Maude is particularly good for applications that
          involve logical reflection and meta-logical programming.  </li>

      <li> The module systems of Ada, ML, C++ and Lotos have all been
          influenced by the OBJ module system; Lotos also uses the initial
          algebra semantics that was pioneered by OBJ. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

<li> <em>What is the state of research in Hidden Algebra?</em>

    <p> Hidden algebra and its implementation technology are
    evolving rapidly at this time.  For the latest information on this and
    related topics, check Joseph Goguen's "What's New" link at the top of his
    <a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/">homepage</a>, and/or browse
