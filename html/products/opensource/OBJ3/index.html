<h2>OBJ3 Summary</h2>

<p> "<a
href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/sys/obj.html">OBJ</a>"
refers to the language family, while "OBJ2", "<a
href="/products/opensource/OBJ3/">OBJ3</a>",
"<a href="http://www.ldl.jaist.ac.jp/cafeobj/">CafeOBJ</a>", etc. refer
to particular members. The OBJ languages are broad spectrum algebraic
programming and specification languages, based on order sorted
equational logic, possibly enriched with other logics, such as
rewriting logic or hidden equational logic. </p>

<p> All the OBJ languages are rigorously based upon a logical system;
more precisely, they are logical languages, in the sense that their
programs are sets of sentences in some logical system, and their
operational semantics is given by deduction in that logical
system. All recent OBJ languages use order sorted algebra, which also
provides a rigorous basis for user definable sub-types, exception
handling, multiple inheritance, overloading, multiple representations,
coercions, and more. They also support user definable mixfix syntax,
user definable execution strategies, rewriting modulo standard
equational theories (associative, commutative, etc.), and selective
memoization. </p>

<p> All recent OBJ languages provide parameterized programming, with
parameterized modules, module instantiation, views, module
expressions, etc., to support very flexible program structuring and
reuse. </p>

<p> OBJ3 is based on order sorted equational logic, and has been
successfully used for research and teaching in software design and
specification, rapid prototyping, theorem proving, user interface
design, and hardware verification, among other things. It was the
first language to implement parameterized programming and its module
system influenced the designs of the Ada, C++ and ML module
systems. </p>

<p> This is OBJ3 version 2.10, an evolution of a cleaned-up release of
OBJ3 2.04 from 1992.  This version is pre-built for Fedora Core 3 on
the x86 architecture and for Mac OS X 10.3. </p>

<p> The TRIM compiler system by Lutz Hamel is included with OBJ3.  He
kindly integrated the TRIM system into our OBJ3 2.06 release - thanks
Lutz!  The original 2.05 update was engineered by Sula Ma.  All later
updates were engineered by Joseph Kiniry. </p>

<p> This release was built and is supported by <a
href="/about/people/jrk.html">Joseph Kiniry</a> and runs under GNU
Common Lisp, CMU Common Lisp, Steel Bank Common Lisp, and CLISP on
ix86/Linux and PPC/Darwin (Mac OS X). </p>
