<h2>README for OBJ3 Source Tree</h2>

<p> Welcome to the OBJ3 source tree. </p>

<h2>Source Structure</h2>

<p> The source code for the OBJ3 system is found in the
"<tt>obj3</tt>" directory.  In particular, note that the standard OBJ3
prelude is included as "<tt>obj3/prelude/obj3sp.obj</tt>". </p>

<p> The source code for the TRIM system is found in the
"<tt>trim</tt>" directory.  The TRIM example code and documentation
are found there as well. </p>

<p> <strong>Many</strong> OBJ3 examples are included in the
"<tt>examples</tt>" directory.  See the readme in that directory for
more information. </p>

<p> A few miscellaneous support programs (coded in C) are available in
the "<tt>support</tt>" directory. </p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p> The OBJ3 system is written in Common Lisp. Modern Common Lisp
systems can compile Lisp code to C, thus a compiled implementation of
OBJ3 is quite efficient. </p>

<p> The last major release of OBJ3 (2.0) took place in April of 1992
and was built by Timothy Winkler, one of the primary OBJ3 developers.
At that time, OBJ3 built properly on several Common Lisp
implementations including: </p>

<ul>
  <li> <em>CMU CL</em> - Carnegie Mellon's Common Lisp's last
      major release (17) from CMU took place in November, 1994.
      CMU-CL is currently under development by a group of interested
      individuals and the 
      <a href="ftp://ftp2.cons.org/pub/languages/lisp/cmucl/release/">latest
      version</a> (18b) was made available in mid-1998.  See 
      <a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/">CMU Common Lisp Activities
      Page</a> for more information.
  </li>
  <li> <em>LUCID CL</em> (now <em>Liquid CL</em> from 
      <em>Harlequin</em>) - A commercial
      Common Lisp implementation that is still sold and supported.
      The latest version at the time of this writing is 5.0.6
      (released December, 1998).
  </li>
  <li> <em>Kyoto Common Lisp (KCL)</em> - Was the primary Lisp
      platform for OBJ3 development in the early 90s.  KCL is a
      highly portable implementation of Common Lisp.  KCL evolved
      into AKCL (Austin Kyoto Common Lisp) by Bill Schelter, which
      then evolved into GNU Common Lisp.  A release of AKCL is
      available from 
      <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/mkant/Public/Lisp/impl/kcl/akcl/">CMU</a>
      but it is circa 1992.  It is unclear how portable or supported
      AKCL is at this time.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The world of Common Lisp implementations has changed over the last
eight years.  The primary free implementation that is widely used and
available today is GNU Common Lisp.  <em>This release of OBJ3 is only
guaranteed to run under GNU Common Lisp (GCL), CMU Common Lisp, Steel
Bank Common Lisp, and CLISP.</em>  </p>

<p> Thanks go primarily to <a
href="mailto:sm@comlab.ox.ac.uk">Sula Ma</a> at Oxford for the
OBJ3 2.04 port to GCL 2.2.2.  Sula is preparing a new branch of
OBJ called "OBJ4", and this port was part of that work. </p>

<p> We are interested in hearing if anyone ports OBJ3 to other Common
Lisp implementations, in particular, LispWorks and <a
href="http://www.franz.com/">Franz Allegro CL</a>. </p>

<p> For a good breakdown of modern Common Lisp implementations, see <a
href="http://www.elwoodcorp.com/alu/table/systems.htm">this
informative page</a>. All other questions about Common Lisp
implementation are probably addressed in the <a
href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/lisp-faq/part1/preamble.html">Lisp
FAQ</a>.  </p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p> To build OBJ3, you need one of the above Common Lisp
implementations and GNU make.  Set the shell variable 'lisp_compiler'
to the executable of the Common Lisp compiler you wish to use, then
type "make" in the OBJ3 root directory.  After the build completes,
the OBJ3 and TRIM executables will be found in the bin directory. </p>
