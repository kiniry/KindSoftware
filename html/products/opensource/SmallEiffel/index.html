    <h2>SmallEiffel and SmartEiffel Ports to AmigaDE/Elate</h2>
    
    <p> We've ported the <a
    href="https://smarteiffel.loria.fr/">GNU SmartEiffel</a>
    compiler to Tao Group's
    <a href="https://tao-group.com/">Elate</a> operating
    environment.  If you haven't yet heard about GNU Eiffel,
    the Elate operating environment, you
    should really look into each. </p>

    <p> <a href="https://smarteiffel.loria.fr/">SmartEiffel</a>
    used to be called "SmallEiffel".  Contrary to its name, is
    a full fledged, Open Source, GPL licensed implementation
    of the Eiffel programming language.  The compiler
    generates high quality, high performance C and Java
    bytecode.  The package includes several reusable libraries
    (called clusters in the Eiffel vernacular), plenty of
    documentation, examples, and more. </p>

    <p> <a href="https://withintent.biz/">Elate/intent</a>
    is a virtual operating system developed by 
    <a href="https://www.tao-group.com/">Tao Group, UK</a>.  It is one
    of the most innovative pieces of software we have seen in
    years.  Elate is a high quality, high performance, robust,
    virtual operating system that runs hosted on a standard
    operating system.  We currently run Elate hosted on Linux and
    Windows. </p>

    <p> The Elate system has a host of lovely features including:
    </p> 
    <ul>
      <li> A preemptive multitasking and multiprocessing kernel
          with a user-configurable (real-time or not)
          scheduler. </li>
      <li> A high performance asynchronous message passing-based
          IPC based on the mailbox metaphor. </li>
      <li> A garbage collector-based system memory
          architecture. </li>
      <li> An object-based clean-room designed assembly language
          called VP (for Virtual Processor) that is the nicest assembly
          we have ever used. </li>
      <li> An innovative "tool"-based architecture for software
          components.  Tools are chunks of (re)usable code, thus a
          library is no longer a set of files or functions, it is a set
          of tools.  Tools are the fundamental unit of compilation,
          translation, analysis, garbage collection, and more.  This
          means that when you load code written in, say, C, C++, or
          Java, <span class="italic">only those portions of the code
          that are necessary are loaded into memory and translated into
          native code</span>.  In other words, why load the full text
          segment of a C program or a C++ class, or why load a full
          classfile for a Java class, when all you need on average is a
          fraction of it?
      </li>
      <li> A data-flow analyzing, load-time, caching VP-to-native
          code compiler that generates excellent native code.  The
          Elate translation system supports nearly thirty (yes, 30)
          chipsets including various processors in the x86 line, MIPS,
          various embedded processors like the SH-4, Thumb, and Arm
          line, PowerPC, and more. </li>
      <li> And a host of the standard little things you would
          expect: a reasonable (but non-standard) command shell, a
          GUI/multimedia toolsuite (called "intent"), a GCC port (full
          C and C++), a <em>very</em> high performance Personal Java
          implementation, signals, interrupts, a file system,
          networking libraries, etc. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> GNU SmallEiffel 0.75 and SmartEiffel 1.0 for Elate 1.3 are
    available here. </p>
