1. DEBIAN BASED SYSTEMS
=======================
   
   The debian build depends on the Sun java version. You must have either
   sun-java6-bin or sun-java5-bin installed.

1.1 Installing on Debian
------------------------

   Add the following line to your sources.list (/etc/apt/sources.list):
     deb http://hunter.ucd.ie/bon/apt unstable contrib

   Then:
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install bonc
     (or just use synaptic manager to update your sources and install bonc).

1.2 Updating on Debian
----------------------

   Once you have added our repository to your sources.list, you should 
   automatically get prompted to install updates to bonc.

   You can force your system to update its software cache by issuing the 
   following command:
     sudo apt-get update

1.3 Running
-----------
   
   The debian release creates a symlink from /usr/bin/bonc to a script that
   sets the relevant environment variables and runs the main script. Thus, bonc
   should automatically be on your path and work correctly.

2. SYSTEMS WITH BASH
====================

   Bonc releases are available from http://kind.ucd.ie/products/opensource/BONc/releases/

2.1 Installing
--------------

  Firstly choose a location to install the software to.
  
  NB. wget does not exist on OSX as standard (although it is available via
      MacPorts and fink). If you don't have wget, you will have to use the 
      non-update script methods for installing and updating (2.1.2 and 2.2.2). 

2.1.1 With the update script

  From the commandline navigate to the desired directory and issue the
  following commands:
    wget http://kind.ucd.ie/products/opensource/BONc/releases/update
    chmod a+x update
    ./update
  
  Alternatively:
    wget -qO - http://kind.ucd.ie/products/opensource/BONc/releases/update | bash
    
2.1.2 Without the update script

  - Visit http://kind.ucd.ie/products/opensource/BONc/releases/
  - Download a package of the latest version (e.g., bonc-XXX.tar.gz).
  - Extract the files to the desired location (e.g. tar xzf bonc-XXX.tar.gz)

2.2 Updating
------------

2.2.1 With the update script

  - From the commandline navigate to the location you previously installed to.
  - Simply run the update script
      ./update
  - The script will determine if there is a newer version and, if so, download
    it and replace the existing version.

  NB. You must be in the actual directory when executing the script 
      (i.e. ./update)

2.2.2 Without the update script

  Simply follow the steps from 2.1.2 for downloading and extracting, ensuring
  that when you extract it will overwrite the existing copy.

2.3 Running
-----------

  When in the directory you have installed to you can invoke bonc by typing
    ./bonc

  If you want to issue the command from any location, you have two choices:
  
  1. Create a bash alias: add the line "alias bonc=/path/to/bonc/bonc" to
     your .bashrc, .bash_aliases or similar. Note that this will use any
     already set value of JAVA_HOME, or the version of java on the path if
     JAVA_HOME is not set
   
  2. Create a short script that sets BON_HOME, JAVA_HOME and then calls the
     actual bonc script. An example of this script is included as 
     "my-bonc.example" in each release. You can then create a symlink from a
     location on your path (e.g. /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin) to this script.

     - Copy my-bonc.example:
         cp my-bonc.example my-bonc
     - Edit my-bonc and fill in the locations for BON_HOME and JAVA_HOME. See 
       2.3.1 below for information on how to set these.
     - Create a symlink from a location in your path to this script:
         sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bonc /path/to/bonc/my-bonc
     
     If you do the above then bonc will be set up to run and unaffected by
     updates of the software (since my-bonc will not be replaced during 
     updates)

  3. Add the installation directory to your path. One way of doing this is to
     add a line like the below to your .bash_profile file:
       export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/install

2.3.1 Setting JAVA_HOME and BON_HOME

  The tool requires two environment variables to be set: JAVA_HOME and BON_HOME.

  BON_HOME can be automatically detected if you are running the script directly 
  (i.e. you are not using a symlink to the script).

  If you do not set JAVA_HOME, and JAVA_HOME is not already set in your 
  environment then the version of java that is on your path will be attempted.

  - BON_HOME must be set to be the location where the tool has been installed.
  - JAVA_HOME must be the location of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version
    1.5/5.0 or greater, such that the file $JAVA_HOME/bin/java is a valid 
    executable.

  NB. The paths set should not include the trailing '/'

  It is possible to edit and set these at the top of the bonc script, but these
  settings are liable to be lost as the script will be replaced during 
  upgrades. To prevent this, you can set their value in your bash configuration
  files (.bashrc, .bash_profile or similar), or using the my-bonc script as
  described in option 2 above. Note that the syntax for setting an environment
  variable in bash is "export VAR=value".

3. WINDOWS WITHOUT CYGWIN
=========================

  Bonc releases are available from http://kind.ucd.ie/products/opensource/BONc/releases/

  1. Download the zip of the latest build.
  2. Unzip the package to a location of your choice.
  3. Edit bonc.bat and set BON_HOME to be the location you extracted to.
  4. Edit bonc.bat and set JAVA to be the java executable you wish to use.
     Note that this can simply be "java" if you want to use the version of
     Java that is already on your path. Otherwise enter the full path of the
     java executable you wish to use.
  5. Run bonc by executing bonc.bat

  You can add bonc to your path by simply editing your path variable and adding
  the path to where you extracted the downloaded build.


4. BUILDING FROM SOURCE
=======================


4.1 Requirements
----------------

  - Building from source requires Java version 5 or later.
  - Building uses Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/). It has been tested on
    version 1.6.5 and 1.7.0, but may work on others.

4.2 Getting the source
----------------------

  You can download the latest source from subversion:
    svn co https://mobius.ucd.ie/repos/src/bon/bonc

4.3 Building
------------

  Inside the directory where you downloaded the source, issuing the command:
    ant compile
  will compile the source (including generating the lexers/parsers through antlr)

  To build a version that can be executed, issue the following command:
    ant dist

  This will create and place all the required files inside the dist/ subdirectory.
  Executing the bonc script located in the dist/ directory will run the built
  version.
