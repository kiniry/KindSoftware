Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Programming technologies have evolved greatly over the years. New
programming models have emerged, new languages have gained popularity,
new tools have been adopted, and yet several core debugging constructs
have not changed.  We believe that the two primary constructs for
general debugging are the <I>execution trace</I> and the
<I>assertion</I>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">
Object-Oriented Debugging</A>
</H2>

<P>
Debugging object-oriented programs is not the same as debugging
procedural ones.  Because most object models enforce modularity and
encapsulation, one must test both the implementation and the interface
of a class.

<P>
A specification of an interface is called a
<I>Contract</I>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node6.html#HamiltonPowellMitchell93">1</A>,<A
 HREF="node6.html#HelmHollandGangopadhyay90">2</A>,<A
 HREF="node6.html#Holland92">3</A>,<A
 HREF="node6.html#Meyer88">4</A>].
A class's contract specifies the externally visible behavior that a
class guarantees.

<P>
Contracts are typically specified via three constructs:
<I>preconditions</I>, <I>postconditions</I>, and
<I>invariants</I>.  Using these three constructs, the safety
properties of a class can be completely specified.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00012000000000000000">
Debugging in Java</A>
</H2>

<P>
Surprisingly, given its popularity, the Java programming language
provides very few built-in constructs for debugging classes.

<P>
Typically, a Java programmer relies upon language features and
development tools for debugging.  Java provides array bounds checking,
static type checking, variable initialization testing, and exceptions
to assist in code debugging.  While programming environments provide
sophisticated source-code debuggers, most developers seem fixated on
using primitive <TT>println</TT>'s to debug their code.

<P>
Java is missing several traditional core debugging constructs, the
most critical of which is <I>assertions</I>.  Assertions are program
statements of the form ``at this point in execution the following
<I>must</I> be true''.  They are used to specify predicates that must
remain inviolate for a program to exhibit correct behavior.
Typically, if an assertion is violated, a program is aborted. In
object-oriented systems we often have options other than halting the
program execution (e.g. throwing an exception).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00013000000000000000">
Debugging Frameworks</A>
</H2>

<P>
A <I>framework</I> is a collection of classes that provides a unified
model and interface to a specific piece of functionality.  A framework
in Java is typically implemented as a collection of classes organized
into a <I>package</I>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00014000000000000000">
IDebug: A Debugging Framework</A>
</H2>

<P>
The IDebug debugging framework is implemented as a set of Java Beans (Java
components) collected into the package <TT>IDebug</TT>.  These classes can
be used either (a) as ``normal'' classes with standard manual debugging
techniques, or (b) as components within visual Java Bean programming tools.

<P>
This package provides many standard core debugging and specification
constructs, such as the previously discussed assertions, debug levels
and categories, call stack, and specialized exceptions.  Debug levels
permit a developer to assign a ``depth'' to debug statements.  This
creates a lattice of information that can be pruned at runtime
according to the demands of the current execution.  Call stack
introspection is provided as part of the Java language specification.
The IDebug framework uses the call stack to support a runtime
user-configurable filter for debug messages based upon the current
execution context of a thread.  Finally, a set of specialized
exceptions are provided for fine-tuning the debug process.

<P>
Additionally, the framework supports extensions for debugging
distributed systems.  One problem typical of debugging distributed
systems is a loss of context when communication between two non-local
entities takes place.  E.g. When object <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$A$"> invokes a method <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$m$"> on
object <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$B$">, the thread within <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$m$"> does not have access to the call
stack from the calling thread in <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$A$">.  Thus, the IDebug package
supports what we call <I>call stack currying</I>.  Information such as
source object identity, calling thread call stack, and more is
available to the debugging framework on both sides of a communication.
Such information can be curried across arbitrary communication mediums
(sockets, RMI, etc.).

<P>
The IDebug package is also being extended to support the debugging of
mobile agent systems.  Mobile agent architectures can support
disconnected computing.  For example, an object <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$O$"> can migrate from
machine <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$A$"> to machine <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$B$">, which might then becomes disconnected from
the network (i.e.  absolutely no communication can take place between
<IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$B$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$A$">).  Since <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$B$"> cannot communicate with <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$A$">, and printing
debugging information on <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$B$">'s display might not be useful or
possible, <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$B$"> must log debugging information for later inspection.  To
support this functionality, the IDebug package will provide
serializable debug logs.  These logs can be carried around by a mobile
object and inspected at a later time by the object's owner or
developer.

<P>
The IDebug package is very configurable.  Debugging functionality can
be fine-tuned on a per-thread basis.  Each thread can have its own
debugging context.  The context specifies the classes of interest to
that particular thread.  I.e. If a thread <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$T$"> specifies that it is
interested in a class <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$C$"> but not a second class <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$D$">, then debugging
statements in <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$C$"> will be considered when <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$T$"> is inside of <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$C$">, but
debugging statements in <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$D$"> will be ignored at all times.  These
debugging contexts can be stored to and recovered from persistent
storage.  Thus, ``named'' special-purpose contexts can be created for
reuse across a development team.
